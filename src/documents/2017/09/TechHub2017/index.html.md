I was honored to be chosen to speak at the [2017 Technology Hub conference](https://www.technologyhubconference.com/) in
Appleton, Wi.

My [session](https://www.technologyhubconference.com/timetable/event/innovation-ai-economy/) was on Innovation, Artificial Intelligence, and the Economy. It was a pretty
different talk for a tech conference, which led to great discussion.
