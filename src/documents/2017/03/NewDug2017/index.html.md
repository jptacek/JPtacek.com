Thanks to everyone who came out to my talk about Docker at the 2017
[NEW Codecamp](http://newcodecamp.com).

The slides for the presentation are available at [slides.google.com](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ip-ybRmXez8bldnk07ug0T2y5Dlbdql20Mf14UCJDeQ/edit?usp=sharing).

The source code can be found on my GitHub repo at
[https://github.com/jptacek/dockerPi](https://github.com/jptacek/dockerPi).

It is great to see so many engaged folks in our NorthEast Wisconsin Developer
community that came out today!
