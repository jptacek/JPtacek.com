John Ptacek is a Skyline Technologies Senior Engineer where his primary focus is the design, development and solutions for customers using SharePoint. He also spends lots of time implementing innovative solutions for clients on the Azure and MVC stacks.

He has also been part of the Skyline team to create Azure and MVC solutions for charities in the Fox Cities including the [Appleton Compassion Project](http://www.appletoncompassion.org) and [Riverview Gardens](http://riverviewgardens.org/). He has been doing web development for Fortune 50 clients across the world over the last 15 years, focused mainly on the Microsoft technology stack.

John realized a life long dream to be paid to walk on a baseball field, but it was as a computer consultant and not because he could hit a curve ball. This has taught him to be careful what you wish for.

As much as John loves doing tech weenie stuff, he enjoys hanging out with his awesome wife and collection of awesome kids.
