I have tried, I have really tried. Since Windows Phone has been released I have been the proud owner of...

1. Samsung Focus
2. Lumia 800 (rocking the blue)
3. Lumia 920
4. Lumia 1020

That is a Windows Phone a year for 4 years, a phone for each year the Windows Phone has been out, 
only one of which was free (the 920 at Microsoft Build one year). Not only have I been 
a fan of the platform, I have been and advocate. I love the Live Tile features of Windows Phone, think the 
sharing features are great. I have been a huge fan Microsoft's Metro design style that was the precursoor to Apple's recent
iOS changes and Google's upcoming ones.

However, enough is enough, it is time to say good bye to Windows Phone. While I love the platform, lately is it just not enough.

What are the reasons

** Apps **
I have never really been a big app fan, most of what I like to do, I can do on the web. However, this has started to 
change recently as more and more companies are going app first, web later. When they go app first, it is always the Apple
platform. The secondary driver for my mindshift on apps is the low energy Bluetooth things goign on. Synching with 
your FitBit, taking advantage of iBeacons, etc. That is an app world only technolgy, and not a web world. 
As a result, Windows Phone
is, due to marketshare, way behind the competition. Also, they don't have any low energy Blue Tooth devices, because
it is a Windows Phone 8.1 feature not available to most right now.

Recently, I have been using an iPhone for testing and have been using the following apps I cannot get on Windows Phone.

* GameChanger * My son plays a lot of baseball. GameChanger is an app that allows parents to keep up to date on games
in almost real time. Available only for iOS

* Snapchat * My kids love Snapchat, epsecially its microblogging story feature. While there is a nice Snapchant 
close (6Snap) in the Windows store, it does not support the story feature

* Instagram * This is still in beta, so you can call it out. However, feature wise

* Garmin Connect * - I have a VivoFit, the Garmin version of a FitBit. 

** My People ** 
I tried hard, like really hard, to get my family to adopt Windows Phone. For various reasons, especially for our 
children, it was not going to be viable. They are intersted in communicating with their peers, and that means
social apps that are always first to iPhone and Android. As hte app world explores, vendors need market pentration to
keep users there. My kids want to Facetime me and check out their Snapchat stories, things I cannot do on Windows Phone. 

** Microsoft Cannot Execute **
Microsoft is in the midst of a major redesign of the Windows Platform. They are creating a Universal App model, where
applications developed for Windows Metro can easily be ported to Windows Phone. This is awesome. However, it is 
taking FOREVER. Microsoft introduced Windows Phone 7 in November of 2010. In October of 2012, they reelased a new version
called Windows 8. This is TWO years later. Oh yea, by the way, previous phones were not upgradeble. They introduced the 
next successor, Windows Phone 8.1 this April at Build. I am not 100% sure if it is actually released yet, but I think 
it is. There are Lumia 630s availabe in Europe that run WP 8.1. They may even be releasing Lumia 930s too. The crazy 
thing though is, 
Microsoft has yet to relase and/or announce a new phone for the US market for their new phone Operating System. Four
months after generating enthusiasm and excitemenet, no new phone models in the US, with the excpetion of the just 
announced low-end Lumia 630 at T-Mobile. This is madness. They have a great platform, have consumer interest
with their Cortana application, and no one can go into a store and buy one in the biggest mobile phone market in the 
world.

Pair this with the fact that between Microsoft and Nokia, who are now one company, they have not released a new flagship
phone in over a year. The Lumia 1020, with its wonderful and mindblowign camera technology was released in July of
2013. Since then, with the exception of the much larger 1520, no new high end Lumia devices in the States. (Calling
Verizon's Icon a rework of the 920). If you cannot get new hardware into the the system, it is hard to create 
enthusiasm, especially when you are behind on market share. No new hardware also means people don't have hardware
to buy, hence the slow growth of Windows Phone market share.

So, all of that to say this.... I am going to be getting a new cell phone, and for the first time in a long time 
it will not be Windows Phone. I hope Microsoft can gain market share and bring the development community along. The
 platform is great, the lack of apps though is really starting to limit its growth potential.
