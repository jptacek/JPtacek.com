I have tried, I have really tried. Since Windows Phone has been released I have been the proud owner of...

1. Samsung Focus
2. Lumia 800 (rocking the blue)
3. Lumia 920
4. Lumia 1020

That is a Windows Phone a year for 4 years, a phone for each year the Windows Phone has been out, 
only one of which was free (the 920 at Microsoft Build one year). I have 
been a fan of the platform. And I really loathe the Apple stack. So much so, that waiting for Windows Phone 7 and hte
Samsung Focus I paid data charges and wouldn't buy an iPhone and had some crappy LG Windows Mobile device. 

And it is not so much that I am a luddite, but I have a long and passionate hatred of iTunes. Every time someone
holds up Apple as the magical kingdom of design, I start iTunes and show them. It is miserable software, especially for 
someone like 
me, who lives with headphones on all day. And this comes from being an EARLY iPod adopter, when MP3s where for just
the nerds. It has scarred me.

However, enough is enough, it is time to say good bye to Windows Phone. I love the operating system, the Metro 
design language, its live tiles, app sharing model, but is it just not enough.

What are the reassons

** Microsoft Cannot Execute **
Microsoft is in the midst of a major redesign of the Windows Platform. They are creating a Universal App model, where
applications developed for Windows Metro can easily be ported to Windows Phone. This is awesome. However, it is 
taking FOREVER. Microsoft introduced Windows Phone 7 in November of 2010. In October of 2012, they reelased a new version
called Windows 8. This is TWO years later. Oh yea, by the way, previous phones were not upgradeble. They introduced the 
next successor, Windows Phone 8.1 this April at Build. I am not 100% sure if it is actually released yet, but I think 
it is. There are Lumia 630s availabe in Europe that run WP 8.1. They may even be releasing Lumia 930s too. The crazy 
thing though is, 
Microsoft has yet to relase and/or announce a new phone for the US market for their new phone Operating System. Four
months after generating enthusiasm and excitemenet, no new phone models in the US, with the excpetion of the just 
announced low-end Lumia 630 at T-Mobile last week. This is madness. They have a great platform, have consumer interest
with their Cortana application, and no one can go into a store and buy one in the states.

** Apps **
I have never really been a big app fan, most of what I like to do, I can do on the web. However, this has started to 
change as more and more companies are going app first, web later. When they go app first, it is always the Apple
platform. The secondary driver for my mindshift on apps is the low energy Bluetooth things goign on. Synching with 
your FitBit, taking advantage of iBeacons, etc. That is an app world, and not a web world. As a result, Windows Phone
is, and as a result of their marketshare, will always be, way behind the competition. 

Here are a list of applications I tried to use in the last week I cannot find on Windows Phone (and I am not making 
this up)

* GameChanger *

* Snapchat *

* Instagram *

* Whatever is new *

** My People ** 
I tried hard, like really hard, to get my family to adopt Windows Phone. For various reasons, especially for our 
children, it was not going to be viable. They are intersted in communicating with their peers, and that means
social apps that are always first to iPhone and Android. As hte app world explores, vendors need market pentration to
keep users there. My kids want to Facetime me and check out their Snapchat stories, things I cannot do on Windows Phone.
