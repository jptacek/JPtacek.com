[AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) is a Javascript MVC framework from the fine folks over at
[Google](http://www.google.com). The focus of Angular is building complex
 HTML based client applications. Its design philosophy is data first, where your data will be updating the DOM.
 Contrast this to a framework like JQuery where the DOM will update your data.

This is the tenth (I know, right!!?!!?!) in a series of posts on AngularJS where we are using Chemistry data from the periodic table
to help us understand the framework. The others posts are

10. AngularJS - More with Directives

>Note: AngularJS does not allow for more than one ng-app directive. When I have multiple angular posts on
the home page of my blog, only one application will work. I need to refactor the entire site to account for
this. All of that to say this, you are best clicking on a single article so you can see the pages in action.
