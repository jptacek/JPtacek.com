Thanks to everyone who came out to my [Milwaukee .NET User Group](http://wi-ineta.org/) presentation on AngularJS this week
(April 8, 2014).
There was a
nice turnout and some good interactions and questions. I even got a little stressed out and winded, with the screen being in the
front of the room and my laptop with code demos in the back! Hopefully it wasn't too distracting for those of you
in attendance.

You can find a copy of my slides [here](AngularJS-Ineta.pptx).

The code for my demo is available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) at https://github.com/jptacek/Wi-Ineta-AngularJS

As always, feel free to reach out to me via email or on twitter.

To those of you who attended, thanks much!
