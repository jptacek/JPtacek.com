Thanks to everyone who came out to my [Madison .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/MADdotNET/) presentation on AngularJS on May 7th,
2014.


You can find a copy of my slides [here](AngularJS.pptx).

The code for my demo is available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) at https://github.com/jptacek/MadDotNet

As always, feel free to reach out to me via email or on twitter.

To those of you who attended, thanks much!
