Thanks to everyone who came out to my [Madison .NET User Group](http://www.meetup.com/MADdotNET/) presentation on AngularJS on May 7th,
2014.

Had a really nice turnout and the group was great to give a talk to! Engaging, with lots of good questions. They even humored me when
I went on a brief Lou Reed interlude!

You can find a copy of my slides on my site [here](AngularJS.pptx).

The code for my demo is available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) at https://github.com/jptacek/MadDotNet along with
the slides.

There are also several blog posts I have written about Angular, http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/. Also, for those
interested in learning more about DocPad, here is a post where I talked about moving over, http://www.jptacek.com/2013/12/saying-hello-to-docpad/

As always, feel free to reach out to me via email (blog -@- jptacek.com) or on twitter, [@jptacek](http://www.twitter.com/jptacek).

To those of you who attended, thanks much!
