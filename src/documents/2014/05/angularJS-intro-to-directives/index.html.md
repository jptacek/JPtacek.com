[AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) is a Javascript MVC framework from the fine folks over at
[Google](http://www.google.com). The focus of Angular is building complex
 HTML based client applications. Its design philosophy is data first, where your data will be updating the DOM.
 Contrast this to a framework like JQuery where the DOM will update your data.

This is the ninth in a series of posts on AngularJS where we are using Chemistry data from the periodic table
to help us understand the framework. The others posts are

1. [AngularJS - Introduction](http://www.jptacek.com/2013/10/angularjs-introduction/)
2. [AngularJS - Introducing AngularJS Controllers](http://www.jptacek.com/2013/10/introducing-angularjs-controllers/)
3. [AngularJS - Introducing NG-Repeat](http://www.jptacek.com/2013/10/angularjs-introducing-ng-repeat/)
4. [AngularJS - More with NG-Repeat](http://www.jptacek.com/2014/01/angularjs-further-with-ng-repeat/)
5. [AngularJS - Image Binding](http://www.jptacek.com/2014/01/angularjs-lou-reed/)
6. [AngularJS - Introducing Templates](http://www.jptacek.com/2014/02/angularJS-templates/)
7. [AngularJS - Introducing Routing](http://www.jptacek.com/2014/02/angularJS-IntroToRouting/)
8. [AngularJS - Introduction to Services] (http://www.jptacek.com/2014/05/angularJS-Intro-To-Services/)

>Note: AngularJS does not allow for more than one ng-app directive. When I have multiple angular posts on
the home page of my blog, only one application will work. I need to refactor the entire site to account for
this. All of that to say this, you are best clicking on a single article so you can see the pages in action.


You can either visit [http://angularperiodic.azurewebsites.net/](http://angularperiodic.azurewebsites.net/) to see the code in action and
as always find the code out on [GitHub](https://github.com/jptacek/AngularPeriodic).
