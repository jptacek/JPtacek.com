My slide deck is online at [http://newdug0916.jptacek.com](http://newdug0916.jptacek.com)
and the Git repo for the slide deck is at
[https://github.com/jptacek/NewDug0916](https://github.com/jptacek/NewDug0916).
I have also created a very vanilla PDF for [download](./NewDug0916-AngularVsReact.pdf).

Thanks again to everyone who came out and engaged in great conversation!
