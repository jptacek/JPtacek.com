Thanks to everyone who came to my presentation at [NEWDUG 2016](http://newcodecamp.com/) this year!
I am always appreciative of the great tech talent we have in NorthEast Wisconsin, and it was certainly evident
with the number of attendees and the quality of the presentations.

If you are interested, the code from the presentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jptacek/NewDug2016).
The PowerPoint presention is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jptacek/NewDug2016/blob/master/PPT/GulpAllTheThings.pptx?raw=true).
