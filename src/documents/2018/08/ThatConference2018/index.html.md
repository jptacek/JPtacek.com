I am a huge fan of life long learning and community, and [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com) allows me to indulge in it each year.

I have also been lucky enough to speak each year at the event (though I had to bail one year
for work commitments).

This year, my [session](https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/12739) was Functional Programminng in JavaScript. During the talk I take a loop through the aspects of Functional 
Programming available in the land of JavaScript.
