Here are the [slides](http://www.jptacek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Day-of-NEt-2013.pptx) from my Fox Valley Day of .NET talks. Thanks to everyone who came out for my presentation. Also, a big thanks to Fox Valley .NET Usergroup board members, Keith Burnell, Greg Levenhagen and Jeff Kruse for putting on such an awesome event.
