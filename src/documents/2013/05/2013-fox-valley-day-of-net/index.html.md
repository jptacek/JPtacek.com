Here are the [slides](Day-of-NEt-2013.pptx) from my Fox Valley Day of .NET talks. Thanks to everyone who came out for my presentation. Also, a big thanks to Fox Valley .NET Usergroup board members, Keith Burnell, Greg Levenhagen and Jeff Kruse for putting on such an awesome event.

Here is a blurry picture of me wearing my tinfoil hat <span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span>
