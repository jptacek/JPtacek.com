    <h1><a href='/2013/03/28/index/'>Setting up Google Two Factor authentication</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 27th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>My daughter was recently asking me what classes she should take for next year, one of the options was Creative Writing. I told her the choice was easy, Creative Writing, &quot;You can never be too good of a writer&quot;. Similarly for the Internet, you can never be too secure.</p>
<p>There are LOTS of horror stories out about people who have had their lives severely impacted by people getting access to their account information. Last year, Matt Honan <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">wrote</a> a cautionary tale about how easily someone was able to take over his digital life for Wired. It is well worth reading. If that one was not enough, then you can read another account from James Fallows <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/308673/?single_page=true">wrote</a> for the Atlantic.</p>
<p>First off, you should be doing basic things. Do NOT use the same password for all sites. DO NOT have passwords that exist in the dictionary. DO have special characters, numbers and mixed case in your passwords. That is just plain, Internet common sense though.</p>
<p>The reality though is, your password is only so good. What everyone should do is setup two factor authentication. Two factor authentication is really &quot;something you know&quot; (your password) and &quot;something you have&quot;, an object like a phone. For enterprise users, this is old hat. The vast majority of large companies require users to have a SecurID card to get access to their network. The card generates a token that changes on a regular internal (60 seconds for example) that user needs to enter when logging in.</p>
<p>However, in the consumer space, this has been much slower in coming. Several years ago Google introduced two factor authentication. Facebook also has the ability for you to enable a variation of two factor authentication. If the browser is not recognized as one you have used before, it will send a SMS to your phone. Twitter is in the process of enabling two factor authentication after 250,000 user accounts were compromised. Microsoft has SOME variation of it. It will occasionally prompt you with a verification code when making account changes or accessing the device from a non-trusted PC. It is however, not a default option for login, and I have never been able to figure out how it decides to send SMS messages. Microsoft really needs to have this option available for those who want it.</p>
<p>We are going to step three enabling Google&#39;s two factor authentication, since so many folks have Google accounts.</p>
<p>To enable Google&#39;s two factor authentication, first, go to your Google Account and click security and find 2-step verification.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For 2-step verification, change the settings form Off to On.</p>
<p>You will then be prompted for a phone number to use for SMS messages. The phone, along with the accompanying verification code, is the second factor of authentication, it is the thing you have. Type in the mobile phone number</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Enter in your phone number and a verification code will be sent to your mobile device. You will then be asked to verify the code</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will then be asked if you want to trust the computer you are on. This will allow you to log in without being prompted with a code very time. This trust usually lasts 30 days.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And then lastly, click confirm</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, each time you log into your Google account from a non trusted computer, a SMS message will be sent to your phone that will need to enter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, this is a bit cumbersome, I grant you. However, it is almost necessary if you are using Google services for anything remotely important to your non-digital world. Do you have bank account information in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you have send yourself passwords in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you have health information in Gmail? Then turn on two factor authentication. Do you use your Google account as your account name for anything important? Then turn on two factor authentication.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to realize. You NEED your cell phone to log into Google services now. If you do not have your cell phone with you, or you are travelling overseas without phone access, then you will not be able to log in to your account. However, Google has several options for you. First, for those on the Android platform they have an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> that will generate the authentication codes for you. Option the second is you can print out a small piece of paper that has a one time, ten digit codes that you can use to get access.</p>
<p>Second, applications that log into Google services to get access to your mail or contacts via POP or IMAP will no longer work. To work around this, Google allows you to create application specific passwords. These passwords are generated on the screen and then you never see them again. There are steps on how to do this at <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185833">http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185833</a>. For those using Outlook, Apple Mail, accessing email via phone, this will need to be done. Those of you paying attention at home will realize you are really back to a single password. While this is true, you cannot get access to your account via web browsers. Second, and more importantly, you cannot manage your account with it. You can also revoke access to anyone of these passwords at any time.</p>
<p>Last, it is good measure to, in Google, Facebook, Twitter, your Microsoft account, anything account you allow to do authorization at other locations, to review what applications you have authorized. So while you are on your account page, review the Connected applications and sites to see who you have authorized to have access, and what level of access to your Google account data.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com032813_1351_SettingupGo7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Personally, I have a Gmail account that I use for my &quot;public&quot; life. It is the address I sign up for things like Facebook with, the email address I use for accessing services I subscribe to, like Netflix, etc. For personal use, I also have a Google Apps domain that I use for personal email with family and friends. Google Apps also support two factor authentication.</p>
<p>As digital identity becomes more and more integrated into daily lives, it is everyone&#39;s responsibility to ensure they can be secure as possible. Take the steps now where you can, because by the time you should have taken the steps, it will be too late.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/04/30/index/'>Being You – Looking Around WordPress</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Apr 29th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>WordPress, is obviously, a VERY popular blogging platform. You are going to have a lot better luck finding information out on the Internets than you will here. So we will take a quick look around, and focus a bit on the differences on the Azure platform.</p>
<p>First off, WordPress is developed on the PHP platform. The vast majority of the management functionality can be done right on the website. This is the dashboard and can be seen below</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At a high level</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Home - This is the main Dashboard page</p>
</li>
<li><p>Posts - These are where you manage your blog posts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Media -This allows you to add and manage media to your site such as images, videos, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pages - These are web pages for your site. A good example would be an about me page</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comments - This is where you manage comments posted to your blog. Be ready for SPAM, lots and lots of SPAM</p>
</li>
<li><p>Appearance - This is where you control the look and feel of your site, add widgets, headers, backgrounds, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plugins - These are third party pieces of functionality you can add to your site. There is a very robust eco system of widgets surrounding WordPress</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users  - Allow you to add users to your site so that more than one person can blog, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tools - Similar to plugins, tools you can add to your site</p>
</li>
<li><p>Settings - These are the general settings of your WordPress blog. For example, the name of the site, time zone, formats, how links are displayed, etc</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing most users will want to do with their WordPress site is select a theme. Much like Plugins, there is a vast ecosystem around WordPress theme development. Users can get a default theme, or find a theme that suites there needs much more closely and pay money for it. </p>
<p>To choose a theme, (get ready for it), go to Appearance and Themes. There is the default themes that ship with the version of WordPress you installed, as of the writing of this, Twenty Twelve and Twenty Eleven.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can go to Install Themes, and look for themes you think are more representative of your site. To get an idea of the options, choose Newest and take a look at the latest site themes people have created.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Personally, and this is a shortcoming, I am really not that interested in aesthetics. So I choose the default Twenty Twelve theme and run with it. One of the things I DO like about this theme is that it utilizes responsive design, so it looks good on a number of form factors.</p>
<p>In your theme, you can choose to customize the theme. This enables you to change site description, updated colors, choose background images, etc</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can choose Site Title and Tagline and change our Tagline to say something different; for example, A Dysfunctional Family, and click Save &amp; Publish</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And the changes are immediately seen on our site.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Just to give an idea of how a theme would work. We can quickly change it and see the effect. Let&#39;s install the Lightweight Personal theme we saw previously. We click the Install now link and it downloads and install the theme locally. We can click the Activate link to have immediately take effect</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And voila! A totally different user experience.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs css">    !<span class="hljs-attr_selector">[]</span>(043013_1113_8<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>)
</code></pre><p>Notice, of course, that our content stays the same, it is just the UI that changes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of how plugins work, let&#39;s install a plugin and take a look. All the cool kids today are on twitter (actually, I am on Twitter, so the cool kids are probably somewhere else), so let us add twitter functionality to our site.</p>
<p>Click plugins on the management dashboard and you will see the default plugins that are installed with WordPress</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Hello Dolly features lyrics from Louis Armstrong&#39;s Hello, Dolly randomly on your site. While I love Louis Armstrong (his two albums, Ella and Louis with Ella Fitzgerald are required listening), the lyrics do not really fit in on our site.</p>
<p>The Akismet plugin is much more useful. It helps you determine what comments are spam on your site, and you will be getting lots of spam. It is worthwhile activating it, though it requires registering for a WordPress account, and if you so desire, paying some money.</p>
<p>For us though, we want to add Twitter to our site. So click the Add New link and search for Rotating Tweets</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We click Install Now and verify we want to install. We are then taken to the post install screen, where we can either activate the plugin, or leave installed, but not activated. Let&#39;s activate by clicking the Activate Plugin link</p>
<p>We now see this on our list of plugins</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Plugins that are activated, then become Widgets. Similar to SharePoint web parts, widgets are items of functionality that can be added to a page. You can add widgets by modifying the appearance of your site. Click Appearance and then Widgets</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The page shows the available widgets and then the side bar widget area. You can drag a Widget from the available section to the sidebar and put in the order you want. We will put our Rotating Tweets widget there by dragging it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nearly all plugins have sections for you to modify for your site. We are going to add a Title and a twitter username and click save</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our site is now updated</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com043013_1113_15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, the WordPress functionality provided by Plugins and Themes allows you to quickly customize your site&#39;s look and feel.</p>
<p>Next time, we are going to dig a big deeper into modifying your site by adding socialization links using PHP and WebMatrix!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/04/29/index/'>Being You – Setting Up WordPress on Azure Websites</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Apr 28th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Azure websites are a great way to get a blog up quick and easily, and for relatively low costs.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we are going to setup a WordPress blog on an Azure websites. Azure Websites provide a great environment for quickly and easily setting up websites to explore different technologies. Are you looking for a place to explore Node.js, create an Azure Website. Want to develop DotNetNuke site and explore, whip up an Azure website and explore to your heart&#39;s content. Looking for a Linux box to do some development for? Create a Virtual Machine</p>
<p>So, what do we need to do?</p>
<p>First things first, you need to sign up for a windows azure account and a 90-day Free Trial. This will require you to provide a mobile phone, for verification purposes, and a credit card, which you only need if you exceed the limits for the free trial, which only happens if you remove the spending limit.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com">http://www.windowsazure.com</a> and click Free Trial. You </p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You free trial contains up to 10 Web Sites and Mobile services, a SQL database, 35 GB of strogae and 750 hours of small compute hours. This will essentially allow you to create a blog a Azure shared instance for free. Click the next arrow (right by two).</p>
<p>You will be asked to verify your account via a SMS message to your phone. Step three will ask you to setup a credit card information, after which, your Azure subscription is being setup</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that your Azure account is setup, you can start creating web sites, virtual machines, storage, etc. We are going to create a blog site, which is a web site. </p>
<p>Jump to the Azure Management portal </p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And click the new button in the bottom left. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click Web Site and chose From Gallery</p>
<p>Azure provide a lot of &quot;starter&quot; sites in it&#39;s Gallery. It can range from DotNetNukeSites, Drupal sites, Wiki sites, eCommerce engines, etc. We are interested in creating blog. Select that and you can see there are a myriad of blog types to choose from</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We are going to use WordPress, a very popular blogging engine based on PHP. Once you find Wordpress, highlight it and click the next button.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.com042913_1148_BeingYouSet6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All Azure Websites are on the domain azurewebsites.net. You will need to select a unique name for your website. In this case, we will use TheEndless.azurewebsites.net for our URL. </p>
<p>Next, WordPress relies on MySql for their back end database, so we will need to create one. The good news is, Azure takes care of all of that for you. Last, you will need to pick a geographic region for your site to be hosted. You want it to be close to where the majority of your users will be. The North Central US datacenter, which is located in Chicago, fits the bill for us.</p>
