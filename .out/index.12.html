    <h1><a href='/2013/05/14/index/'>That Conference 2013</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">May 13th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>That Conference 2013 tickets go on sale tomorrow (5/15). If you are invested in your career and love making the web a more awesome place, you should be buying a ticket. Allow me to ramble a bit and elaborate...</p>
<p>That Conference (<a href="http://www.ThatConference.com">http://www.ThatConference.com</a>) is a three day conference (August 12<sup>th</sup> -14<sup>th</sup>) in its second year and is hosted in Wisconsin Dells. For those of you from not around here (here being Wisconsin), the Dells is a huge tourist destination located about an hour north of Madison, WI.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/05/14/index/051413_1125_ThatConfere1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The thing I loved most about last year&#39;s That Conference is the community aspect. The main mad-scientist behind bringing the conference together is <a href="http://csell.net/">Clark Sell</a>. Clark is passionate about what he does. You can tell he loves getting on the keyboard and hitting the compile button. However, the true genius of Clark (and make no mistake, it is genius) is Community and it permeates the conference in ways that folks may not realize. There is a longer break between sessions than there is at most conferences. You are either forced to be bored out of your skull or actually say to someone, &quot;Hey, that is a pretty awesome Hold Steady concert shirt, are you a fan?&quot; and then many hours later you are closing down the bar with your new buddy. There are Open Spaces going on throughout the conference, and I do not know if it was dumb luck or inspired room placement (I am going inspired room placement because I still want to believe in Santa Clause) but there is a constant flow of people through the room, engaging with one another. Clark and the rest of the Camp Staff, to the best of their ability, make sure the speakers meet the &quot;Not a Jerk&quot; rule. You can be sure if Clark or the rest of the Camp Staff know the speaker, then that speaker is going to be someone you can go up to after their talk, or anytime during the conference and bend their ear and they will stop what they&#39;re doing, listen and offer suggestions and help. Whether you realize it or not, Clark and the staff will go out of their way to make sure you make new connections during the week and you will be better for it.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/05/14/index/051413_1125_ThatConfere2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, the <a href="http://www.thatconference.com/Speakers">speaker list</a> is outstanding. Last year saw keynotes from Richard Campbell of<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com"> .NET Rocks</a> fame, Scott Hanselman of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> fame and Leon Gersing, the <a href="http://about.me/leongersing">Ruby Buddha</a>, who probably had the best received keynote of them all. The thing that differentiated the keynotes at That Conference for me last year was that they were more focused on life outside of code. You are about to have a day full of deep technical dives into a wide and varied array of topics. Each of the key notes though were more focused on the developer outside of developing code. Hansleman focused on making sure you were not overwhelmed in the flow of information we all see, Campbell talked about the sea of change in front of everyone with mobile devices and offered perspective and history while Gersing asked everyone to follow their passion. I thought it was awesome.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s <a href="http://viewer.expresspigeon.com/view_online?v=nw4iq517o5pj4xjjowmwkyyaios35756dxb559mt37smo61mqbtegc18tj46zz3mca17i1jc3gx74xpzgogo697zqcgsgynyatizmpa">keynoters</a> promise to be along the same level of greatness. Doc Norton is the Director of Engineering at Groupon and has a great background in delivering large scale applications. Dave Thomas helped create Ruby and wants you to enjoy what you are doing. Denise Jacobs is probably the talk I am most excited to see. I have heard many great things about her presentations throughout the Interwebs and couldn&#39;t be more excited to see her in person.</p>
<p>That however is only the tip of the iceberg. The speaker list (or Camp Counselors in keeping with the Summer Camp for Geeks theme) is full of top notch national speakers, and they are all coming to my backyard of Wisconsin. Richard Campbell and Leon Gersing will be back. Pete Brown, who does awesome things in his garage, is back presenting. Tim Huckaby is going to be presenting as is Beth Massi. There is a whole list of people I follow on Twitter and have seen present at national conferences like Tech-Ed and Build that will be coming to Wisconsin for three days in August.</p>
<p>On a personal level, six of my fellow Skyline Technologies peers will be speaking. I know the passion each of them have for what they do in their day to day, and even more important, how willing they are to share their experiences and help developers around them. What blew me away about last year, is that each session I attended, you could see that same passion in the speakers. They are not speaking because their boss is telling them to, they are speaking because they love what they do and they want you to share.</p>
<p>Usually tourist areas during the busy season makes me break out into hives, but it really works for the conference (not the hives, the location). It is hosted at a huge resort complex, <a href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/wi/">The Kalahari</a>, which has a water park associated with it. This is genius for two reasons; 1) water parks are fun for adults, 2) water parks are MORE fun for children. For those of you with families, this is a GREAT summer event where you can bring your spouse/significant other with you. And if you have children in your life, it is a great get away for you and your people. The Camp Staff have family friendly events like game night, and even more awesome, a coding for kids event, which will be hosted by Keith Burnell. Great fun.</p>
<p>For the cost of $349, you are not going to find a better deal on making yourself a better developer. More important though, if you are in the Midwest you are investing and supporting something awesome in your backyard, and you can never have enough awesome in your backyard. By attending Year Two and making it great, we all make sure we get to go to an even greater Year Three. Most importantly though, you are going to build your community. You will meet people engaged and passionate in what they do and help you realize that you too are doing awesome by being part of the community. Starting tomorrow, sign up is <a href="http://thatconference2013.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. I will see you in August!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/04/30/index/'>Being You – Looking Around WordPress</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Apr 29th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>WordPress, is obviously, a VERY popular blogging platform. You are going to have a lot better luck finding information out on the Internets than you will here. So we will take a quick look around, and focus a bit on the differences on the Azure platform.</p>
<p>First off, WordPress is developed on the PHP platform. The vast majority of the management functionality can be done right on the website. This is the dashboard and can be seen below</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At a high level</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Home - This is the main Dashboard page</p>
</li>
<li><p>Posts - These are where you manage your blog posts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Media -This allows you to add and manage media to your site such as images, videos, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pages - These are web pages for your site. A good example would be an about me page</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comments - This is where you manage comments posted to your blog. Be ready for SPAM, lots and lots of SPAM</p>
</li>
<li><p>Appearance - This is where you control the look and feel of your site, add widgets, headers, backgrounds, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plugins - These are third party pieces of functionality you can add to your site. There is a very robust eco system of widgets surrounding WordPress</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users  - Allow you to add users to your site so that more than one person can blog, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tools - Similar to plugins, tools you can add to your site</p>
</li>
<li><p>Settings - These are the general settings of your WordPress blog. For example, the name of the site, time zone, formats, how links are displayed, etc</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing most users will want to do with their WordPress site is select a theme. Much like Plugins, there is a vast ecosystem around WordPress theme development. Users can get a default theme, or find a theme that suites there needs much more closely and pay money for it. </p>
<p>To choose a theme, (get ready for it), go to Appearance and Themes. There is the default themes that ship with the version of WordPress you installed, as of the writing of this, Twenty Twelve and Twenty Eleven.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can go to Install Themes, and look for themes you think are more representative of your site. To get an idea of the options, choose Newest and take a look at the latest site themes people have created.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Personally, and this is a shortcoming, I am really not that interested in aesthetics. So I choose the default Twenty Twelve theme and run with it. One of the things I DO like about this theme is that it utilizes responsive design, so it looks good on a number of form factors.</p>
<p>In your theme, you can choose to customize the theme. This enables you to change site description, updated colors, choose background images, etc</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can choose Site Title and Tagline and change our Tagline to say something different; for example, A Dysfunctional Family, and click Save &amp; Publish</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And the changes are immediately seen on our site.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Just to give an idea of how a theme would work. We can quickly change it and see the effect. Let&#39;s install the Lightweight Personal theme we saw previously. We click the Install now link and it downloads and install the theme locally. We can click the Activate link to have immediately take effect</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And voila! A totally different user experience.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs css">    !<span class="hljs-attr_selector">[]</span>(043013_1113_8<span class="hljs-class">.png</span>)
</code></pre><p>Notice, of course, that our content stays the same, it is just the UI that changes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of how plugins work, let&#39;s install a plugin and take a look. All the cool kids today are on twitter (actually, I am on Twitter, so the cool kids are probably somewhere else), so let us add twitter functionality to our site.</p>
<p>Click plugins on the management dashboard and you will see the default plugins that are installed with WordPress</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Hello Dolly features lyrics from Louis Armstrong&#39;s Hello, Dolly randomly on your site. While I love Louis Armstrong (his two albums, Ella and Louis with Ella Fitzgerald are required listening), the lyrics do not really fit in on our site.</p>
<p>The Akismet plugin is much more useful. It helps you determine what comments are spam on your site, and you will be getting lots of spam. It is worthwhile activating it, though it requires registering for a WordPress account, and if you so desire, paying some money.</p>
<p>For us though, we want to add Twitter to our site. So click the Add New link and search for Rotating Tweets</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We click Install Now and verify we want to install. We are then taken to the post install screen, where we can either activate the plugin, or leave installed, but not activated. Let&#39;s activate by clicking the Activate Plugin link</p>
<p>We now see this on our list of plugins</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Plugins that are activated, then become Widgets. Similar to SharePoint web parts, widgets are items of functionality that can be added to a page. You can add widgets by modifying the appearance of your site. Click Appearance and then Widgets</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The page shows the available widgets and then the side bar widget area. You can drag a Widget from the available section to the sidebar and put in the order you want. We will put our Rotating Tweets widget there by dragging it.</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nearly all plugins have sections for you to modify for your site. We are going to add a Title and a twitter username and click save</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our site is now updated</p>
<p><img src="/2013/04/30/index/043013_1113_15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, the WordPress functionality provided by Plugins and Themes allows you to quickly customize your site&#39;s look and feel.</p>
<p>Next time, we are going to dig a big deeper into modifying your site by adding socialization links using PHP and WebMatrix!</p>
