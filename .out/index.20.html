    <h1><a href='/2014/03/02/index/'>Speculations for Build 2014</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 1st, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Build is a Microsoft developer conference that has taken the place of their Professional Developer Conference (PDC). The first
Build was held in 2011 and introduced the world to Windows 8, along with an early preview of Windows 8 and a Samsung tablet.
You can read my thoughts on Build 2011 <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2011/09/observations-from-microsofts-build-conference/">here</a>.
In 2012, Build was held in Seattle and saw the release of Windows 8 and
Microsoft’s Surface RT tablet.  In 2013, Build was held in San Francisco and Microsoft announced Windows 8.1 as well as
made available a preview
release for developers. Before Build 2013 last year, I took a <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/06/Speculation-Microsoft-Build/">stab</a> at
 speculating about what would be coming and did pretty spectacularly bad. With Build 2014 a
month away, I thought it would be fun to try again!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.combuild2013.png" alt="Build 2013"></p>
<p>First, it is interesting to look at how short the time is becoming between Microsoft Build conferences</p>
<ul>
<li>Build 2011, Anaheim, CA September 13 - 16, 2011</li>
<li>Build 2012, Seattle, WA October 30 - November 2, 2012 (~13 months later)</li>
<li>Build 2013, San Francisco, CA June 26-28, 2013 (~8 months later)</li>
<li>Build 2014, San Francisco, CA April 2-4, 2014 (~9 months later)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that Microsoft is quickly iterating and getting information out to developers. However, having said that, certain parts
of Microsoft are executing VERY fast (I am looking at you Azure) and other parts are executing VERY slow (I am looking at you Windows
Phone). With the breadth of developer platforms Microsoft has, they have many opportunities to get in front of developers, but it
not always what the developers are expecting. So all of that to say this.... A lot of my speculation for Build this year looks a lot like last year! There are still some
important pieces for the Microsoft developer story that I believe have yet to be communicated.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.comguitar.jpg" alt="3D Printer Guitar"></p>
<h3 id="one-api-to-rule-them-all">One API To Rule Them All</h3>
<p>The reality is, developing on the Microsoft stack
today can be downright confusing. You have options between....</p>
<ul>
<li>Web using MVC with HTML/JS/CSS</li>
<li>Web using Silverlight (version of XAML), though this is deprecated</li>
<li>Desktop using WPF (version of XAML)</li>
<li>Windows Modern/Metro/Store Apps using WinJS with HTML/JS/CSS</li>
<li>Windows Modern/Metro/Store Apps using XAML</li>
<li>Windows Phone (version of XAML)</li>
</ul>
<p>For shops that are all in on the Microsoft stack, it can be confusing to determine what to go all in on. If you are a web developer
and love HTML and JavaScript, your options are limited for Windows Phone. If you love all things XAML, you have to choose amongst
WPF, Windows Phone or Windows 8 flavor of XAML. And while the XAML platforms are similar, they are not similar enough to not
have a lot of rework. Things have gotten better though over the years with the introduction of the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CrossPlatformPortableClassLibrariesWithNETAreHappening.aspx">Cross-Platform portable class
library</a>, though it is still cumbersome hitting
multiple endpoints.</p>
<p>Last summer I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>One API To Rule Them All</strong> – With the core of Windows driving Xbox One, Windows Phone and Windows 8, will Microsoft release a single API that enables development across all of their platform? That would be great to see and could drive a lot of great applications across Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox!</p>
</div>

<p>This year, I can write the same thing. There have been <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/rumor-windows-phone-81-ditch-back-button">rumors</a>
 coming from a leaked release of the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK of Universal Binaries that will allow Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows
 RT/Metro/Modern/Store Apps have a common base. According to the earlier link, over 75% of Windows Phone and Windows RT have
 the same shared API. That would be a great starting point for Windows 8 developers, especially if WinJS development is now an option
 for Windows Phone 8.1. Giving developers the opportunity to have one platform they can choose to develop on and hit multiple devices
 in the Microsoft devices strategy would be a great leap forward.</p>
<h3 id="windows-rt">Windows RT</h3>
<p>Last summer I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>Windows RT</strong> – Microsoft Windows RT, the ARM based version of their Operating System, is in a weird place. It runs Metro/Modern Design apps in a full touch mode. It also ships with a subset of Microsoft Office such as Word and Excel. However it does not run other Windows applications. What it does do is run all day on a single charge. It is a great productivity tool for knowledge workers. However, with the release of Intel’s Haswell chipset it seems that all-day battery life will be available on much more powerful chipsets. What, then, becomes the future of Windows RT? Will it move to being Microsoft Windows Phone OS? Will Microsoft reduce the cost of Windows RT to get more hardware vendors building machines? Maybe we will find out more at Build!</p>
</div>

<p>Again, same thing this Build. Windows RT has not had a lot of explanation about its continued existence in the Windows ecosystem.
I am not 100% sure, but I believe the only devices released for WinRT in 2013 were from Lumia (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/tablet/lumia2520/">Lumia 2520</a>) and Microsoft
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-2">Surface2</a>). The good news is, both of these devices were well received.
The battery life and productivity for ARM based tablets running RT make for great use cases. However, as Intel releases improved Haswell and Atom chips with great battery
life and the ability to run desktop applications, it doesn&#39;t make long term sense for Microsoft to support both platforms the way they are now.
Unless, Microsoft is focused on making Win RT the phone platform
as well as a tablet only platform, without the legacy desktop. I am pretty sure this is the case, but we haven&#39;t heard it from
Microsoft yet. Maybe this Build we will?!?!</p>
<h3 id="devices-and-services-company">Devices and Services Company</h3>
<p>Microsoft has repeatedly said they are now a devices and services company. Since this announcement in 2012, they have released both Windows
Surface Pro and Windows Surface RT, along with follow up versions in 2013. The Pro update was minimal in terms of hardware (adding the Haswell chip),
but the Surface RT 2,
now called Surface 2, saw a pretty significant upgrade in performance and hardware. In 2013, the release of Xbox One happened. Other
than that, not a whole lot in terms of devices.</p>
<p>Obviously, the purchase of Nokia&#39;s Lumia line will see a lot more Microsoft devices being released in 2014.
However these will be phone devices, there
has not been a 7-8 inch Surface release to compete with the iPad Mini or Kindle fire, the fastest growing tablet market. There also has not been a
Microsoft Laptop/Ultrabooks released. Further, we still are not sure what happens
to the Lumia Brand and the Surface Brand. Will they merge? Will one replace the other? Will one be the Tablet platform and the other the
Phone platform? Will one be for consumers and the other for enterprises? An explanation of these brands moving forward would be great!</p>
<p>I expect that Build 2014 will shed a lot more light on this, especially the company&#39;s strategy for integrating Nokia and the possible
announcement of a Surface Mini. In general, except for the first Build, it is not a place where Microsoft announces hardware though.</p>
<h3 id="xbox-one">Xbox One</h3>
<p>With the news that Xbox One is built on Windows 8, and a tease at Build 2013 about a JavaScript based API for Xbox One, everyone
I talk with thinks Xbox One will be part of Build 2014. Bring it on! This will be exciting for indie developers.</p>
<h3 id="windows-phone">Windows Phone</h3>
<p>My guess, and that of many others, is above all things, Build 2014 will be about Windows Phone 8.1. I, and most of the world, expect them to show Windows Phone
8.1 while hitting on the developer story. It may be even that some new Lumia devices are announced to drive developer enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="kinect-for-windows-rt">Kinect for Windows RT</h3>
<p>Last year I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p>Microsoft’s Kinect is impressive technology. Microsoft released a Kinect for Windows last year, but the hardware did not work on the RT side of the house. Will there be APIs in Windows RT for Kinect? Will there be new Kinect hardware?</p>
</div>

<p>This year, I again hope that the Kinect API will be part of the Win Metro API so developers can take advantage of the Kinect in
Windows 8.1 apps. The technology is too impressive for Microsoft to just let it be used on the Xbox platform!</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s Azure platform is amazing. The degree to which the Azure team can execute and release new features is dizzying. As someone
who is a big proponent of the cloud for organizations to embrace, I spend time following the various platforms. It is hard to keep up
with all the great things the Azure team is doing.</p>
<p>The one
thing that I am most interested in seeing from Microsoft over the next year, is if the speed of execution that Satya Nadella bought to the Azure team
when he led the group, can be bought to the whole Microsoft organization. If there is one person from within Microsoft that can
execute on the Microsoft One strategy, it is Satya. It will be something to watch in 2014.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-name">Pick a Name</h3>
<p>I am still very confused by what Microsoft calls its non-desktop platform, aka the Windows formerly called Metro. Is it Windows Store apps?
Is it Modern apps? Is it Win RT? What is the Microsoft design language formerly known as Metro called? It would be nice to clearly and
concisely pick the terms and have everyone use the same vocabulary. Even the Microsoft developers presenting at previous Builds still call
everything Metro!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have the sense that Build 2014 is really Build 2013, part 2. A lot of the pieces that weren&#39;t fully basked for Build last June, like Xbox One and Windows Phone 8.1,
 should
be announced this April. I am quite hopeful that the Microsoft One vision will be introduced for developers at Build 2014.
 I believe this will really help Microsoft accelerate application across multiple platforms and give developers a sense
 of ease about a single execution strategy. More to come!</p>
<p> I will be out at Build 2014. Feel free to hit me up on twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/jptacek">@jptacek</a> if you are out there in
 April.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/03/17/index/'>Twitter Bootstrap Themes</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 16th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>With a name like Ptacek, you would of course, have to know I am half-Irish. So, to celebrate, we are going to wrap
up a St Patrick&#39;s Day theme for the blog today (3/17/14). You may be saying to yourself, how could I spend so much time and effort totally
retheming the blog to support a relatively minor holiday on the calendar? Easy! Twitter Bootstrap themes!</p>
<p>Twitter Bootstrap, is obviously, a very popular web CSS framework. It enables web developers, without a lot of CSS expereince to
quickly create responsive sites that look decent out of the box. One of the interesting things you can do with version 3 of
Twitter Bootstrap is quickly  update your site easily using themes.</p>
<p>With Twitter Bootstrap, there are two ways you can do things. Option 1 is to download the minified files. This will result in three
separate files, <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> , <code>bootstrap-theme.min.css</code> and <code>bootstrap.min.js</code>, which
is used in conjunction with jQuery. The theme elements are then contained in the <code>bootstrap-theme.min.css</code> file.</p>
<p>The second approach you can use is to download the source files and compile the CSS yourself. This is done by downloading
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> files and using your favorite LESS compiler to generate CSS. There are also SASS files for the
 Ruby fans of the world. With the LESS approach,
there are separate files for theming, a <code>variable.less</code> file and a bootstrap theme file. This is the approach I use for this site
and most projects I start. Within the main <code>site.css</code> LESS file I import the theme files</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml">@import "bootstrapTheme/bootswatch.less";
@import "bootstrapTheme/variables-bootswatch.less";
</code></pre>
<p>The reason I like using the LESS approach rather than just downloading the minified CSS files is the theme part is a bit more
isolated. I can keep all the theme content, which I really think of as the &quot;skin&quot; for a Bootstrap site, in two separate files.
This enables new versions of Bootstrap to be downloaded without loosing other CSS changes and to quickly swap them out, like we
are doing here for St. Patrick&#39;s Day.</p>
<p>It should be noted, that out of the box, Twitter Bootstrap ships with a default theme, a theme that makes the site look like
Twitter Bootstrap 2.x. There is quite a growing community for creating themes for bootstrap (it&#39;s not WordPress type size,
that would just be crazy talk). Example sites include <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap.com</a>, <a href="http://bootstraptor.com/">Bootstraptor</a>
and the one I tend to gravitate to, <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>.</p>
<p>To update your site UI you just simply download either minified CSS files and swap them out, or two LESS files and then reference
them in your site. Since I use LESS, I download the LESS files, rename them to a theme name, which allows me to keep my original,
and then update my <code>site.css.less</code>. I called the St Patrick&#39;s Day theme shamrock and my references are now</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml">@import "bootstrapTheme/shamrock-bootswatch.less";
@import "bootstrapTheme/shamrock-variables.less";
</code></pre>
<p>Viola, a save and a publish later we have a total site look! It is like <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSSZenGarden</a> for
mortals.</p>
<p> <img src="http://www.jptacek.com/2014/03/Twitter-Bootstrap-3-Themes/BuildStPatty.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Rules"></p>
<p>You can find the St Patrick&#39;s Day theme I downloaded from Bootswatch <a href="http://bootswatch.com/shamrock/">here</a>. Obviously,
 since this is just for a short time, there are some UI things that would need to be redone on the site, but we will
 be back to our regularly scheduled programming soon!</p>
<p>Totally useless Ptacek news.... Obviously, the half Irish comes from my Mother&#39;s side. My Uncle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Durkin">Tom Durkin</a>, a somewhat famous horse
race announcer who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/sports/28durkin.html?version=&amp;action=click&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;region=searchResults#0&amp;module=Search&amp;url=http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/tom+durkin/&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1395057931-WaqX7ynUlBWydjqQznsZ1w">used to call</a> the Kentucky Derby and other Triple Crown races on television, would often get flown over
to call the Irish Derby. Here is one of my favorite race calls he has ever done, but probably more appropriate for Talk
Like a Pirate Day</p>

<p>Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/03/18/index/'>A Modest Proposal For Time</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 17th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Time, when you really think about it, is CRAZY. We expect it to be this constant in life, slowly, we hope, marching forward,
but invariably going quicker than we want. However, the concept of time, as in “What time is it?” has changed over
the centuries, with the pace escalating during the information age. If there is one thing Einstein taught us with the Theory of
Relativity, it is that time is not constant.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.commeltingTime.jpg" alt="Melting Time"></p>
<p>There are really two ideas of time… The first, relates to the time on a clock that we all reference. The second, is the larger concept of time that is part of the theories that
Einstein laid out in his Special and General Theories of Relativity. We will focus on the clock for most of this.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.comeinstein.jpg" alt="Einstein"> (gratuitous Einstein picture)</p>
<p>When I interview people for jobs, or talk with young programmers, I will sometimes ask a variation of this question, &quot;you are running a
website and are taking orders for customers all over the world, how do you handle the date and time of an order?&quot; This question
is amazingly complex.</p>
<p>First, you get an idea if the person has a grasp of time zones and local geography beyond the one they are in,
which is always a good first step. This leads to other discussions. Do they mention Daylight Saving Time? Do they mention 
what a pain Indiana and/or Arizona are,
 neither of which recognize Daylight Saving Time?</p>
<p>They make it this far, you are happy. Next however, you hope they mention there really isn’t a decent way to know where a 
user
is when they place an order so that you can display a time when they think they bought their product.
 Unless they explicitly provide 
an address or a time zone, you are not guaranteed to know where they are. You can
 guess based on things like IP address, however, this costs money. You can ask the user if your application can use their 
 browser geolocation feature to determine where they are, but if they are like me, this is a sign to go to another site.</p>
<p>So, you say to yourself, the best thing I can do when a user places an order is to ask them to provide a username that is tied
to a physical address in the real world. This will surely solve the problem! No, it really won’t….. Do you save the time zone where they placed the order? If I
am vacationing in sunny California and order the latest Marvel Blu-Ray to be shipped to my house, what is the proper order time
from my perspective? The time back home or the time where I am?</p>
<p>None of this touches on craziness of time zone names. I live in the United States Midwest, home of Central Standard Time (CST).
However, there is also Cuba Standard Time, China Standard Time, and Central Standard Time in Australia, all claiming the acronym
CST. Which one wins?</p>
<p>So it is a GREAT interview question because you get an idea of the breadth of experience of a candidate in dealing with
large scale applications. However, I only tend
to ask this question if I am trying to be a deliberate jerk. It is a difficult question.</p>
<p>If you work with large companies or companies with interests all over the world, you realize how much time you spend talking
about time. Most people I talk to have no idea that when it is 8:00 AM in the United States Midwest, in India it is
6:30 PM. That is right, not only is the time many hours different than ours, it is staggered 30 minutes. Throw in the fact
that countries all over the world have different ways of dealing with Daylight Savings Time and sometimes their governments
will change it at the last minute and you have many, many opportunities for error. Time is a constant source of discussion when you
work with people across the globe. That discussion of time costs the world money and effectiveness.</p>
<p>So, I propose a few things. First, let me start in the United States. Let us abolish Daylight Savings Time. There really is no
need for this anymore. We are not at war, and the cost savings for going through this process twice a year have not been <a href="http://phys.org/news/2014-03-daylight-energy.html">proven
out</a>. Every person in Illinois who has missed a meeting with a colleague in
Indiana when we “spring forward” or “fall back” can
verify this.</p>
<p>Second, and I assume much more controversially, let us abandon time zones in the United States. We live in a time and place where we
ALL need to be on the same time as a country. In our agrarian past, it may have made sense for 12:00 PM to represent when the
sun was at its apex. However, for the most part, we are NOT an agrarian society currently. Our economy is an information and
finance based economy. I can guarantee you, stock brokers living in California, don’t wake up at 9:30 AM PST for the opening bell
on Wall Street, they wake and are ready to serve their customers every day by 6:30 AM PST to match the 9:30 AM EST opening bell. Our
economy already is driven by the time when business happens, not when we want it to happen.</p>
<p>Many folks may think the idea of a single time zone in the states is crazy talk, and it probably is. As a country, we tend to
be obstinate to change and prefer to cling to the way things have been done (I am looking at you Metric
System conversion). However, time marches on, and more importantly, our economy marches
on. It wasn’t until commerce became widespread, that the concept of time (or more exactly, time keeping) became prevalent in order
to facilitate commerce. Our
economy though has moved past local time, it has moved global. The reality is that countries like China are already ahead of us
here, with a single time that spans five time zones. One needs to only look at the image of the differing morass of
time zones from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">WikiPedia</a>
to realize there is a huge opportunity for improvement.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jptacek.comwikiTimeZones.png" alt="WikiPedia time zones"></p>
<p>So then, let us take it to the logical conclusion. We should wipe out time zones everywhere in the world. They are no longer
needed. ALL business should act on the same time. The first benefit of this is that the mental energy the world spends each day
to just set up a meeting with colleagues disappears. Instead of everyone doing a little math determining their GMT offset, they just say what time.
Everyone has the same reference. It all gets done much quicker. We loose the concept of 12:00 PM being when the sun is brightest,
but the benefits are huge.</p>
<p>The second benefit is that computer systems are MUCH more efficient. While we will never get past the scourge of developers
checking if an item is NULL, the second thing they spend their time on is dealing with dates and times in their programming
language of choice. By consolidating on a single global time, that problem disappears. That is pretty cool. You may think this is
 superfluous, but it is analogous to the metric and British system of units. One need only look at the loss of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">Mars Climate
 Orbiter</a> because of unit conversions to realize there are real reasons for
 simplicity and very high costs for ignoring it!</p>
<p>So then, what time is it? Well, the answer is easy. We already have it and it is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</a>. The interesting thing is, from a
programming standpoint, we are all moving there. If you do multi time zone or country work, you are most likely already saving
time as UTC. If you aren’t, you soon will be as you move to a cloud infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure already
default to UTC since their servers are geographically dispersed and they need to standardize on tme.
This is so prevalent, that for me personally, on my development PCs I have two times displayed,
one for local time and one for UTC time. When I code, I spend more time in
UTC than my local time zone.</p>
<p>It is time for the geeks of the world to lead the charge on this. We need to encourage businesses to focus on driving costs
down for doing business globally. We need to challenge politicians to take up the banner and make the world more connected and
consolidated by having a single global time.</p>
<p>In the news lately has been the disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370. Take for instance this article at the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/world/asia/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-370.html">New York Times</a>
that discusses the timeline of the plane radar reading. It says the last contact happened at 2:15 am local time. First, I
 assume they mean local time in Malaysia and not New York. If it is Malaysia, I have no idea without a little
 Internet searching what time that is for me. I think a good way to begin the journey is to whenever we display time to also
  display the UTC time. So 2:15 am local time in Malaysia becomes 2:15 am/Saturday 18:15 U, where the U designation indicates
 Universal time.</p>
<p>How hard can it be?!?!? Probably hard, the reality is it is coming sooner or later, with sooner being better.
However, amazing things happen every day. Let us start. I am posting this article at 6 AM in the morning, but 11:00 U
wherever you are.</p>
