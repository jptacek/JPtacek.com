    <h1><a href='/2014/01/11/index/'>What is Yammer... and why should your company use it?</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Jan 10th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In real life, I can tend to be a socially awkward computer geek. In digital life, I am quite social where I have accounts on
<a href="/2014/01/11/index/www.twitter.com/jptacek">Twitter</a>, <a href="/2014/01/11/index/www.linkedin.com/in/johnptacek">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://plus.google.com/+JohnPtacek">Google+</a>,
etc. Recently, our company has started using Yammer and I struggled with do I need another social media account. How does Yammer work better than the sites I already use? How does it supplant and/or supplement the awesome way Skyline uses SharePoint to drive collaboration within our growing company?</p>
<p>One of my favorite words to use is Grok. It is from Robert Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land. Essentially, grok is to understand something truly (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok</a>). I try on occasion to grok things. It doesn’t always work well. So, here is where I am currently on trying to grok Yammer and how it can be used in SharePoint, within our teams, and Skyline (or your company) to enable us to better deliver for our clients.</p>
<p>So what is the first thing I think….. Yammer is ALL about the timeline. What do I mean by that? Let me start by example. I walk around with what I call my little black book, which is a Moleskine I use for writing stuff in it all the time. It is meeting notes, To-Dos, etc. I used to use OneNote a lot, but the reason I moved away from it is there is no sense of the flow of time. I know if I wrote something ~ three months ago, but I don’t know if I wrote it in a SharePoint ideas folder, a blog ideas folder, or my dev things to explore. I was impacted because I never had a good way to see things chronologically by paging through the content flow. The lack of timeline has moved me away from OneNote unless it is recording info from my brain. I use it for information I need at a later point. For example, what are my favorite recipes, what is the URL that explains WIF security, what is the wireless password, what music do I need to check out, that kind of stuff. OneNote has become the persistence mechanism for information I need.</p>
<p>I see SharePoint as the location of storage for information for companies. Essentially where instead of looking for information that is pertinent to me, SharePoint is information that is important to an organization. It is there for persistence of business information. What is the customer deliverable for a project, where is information about our benefits, where is the blog post one of my colleagues wrote on FAST search. However, not all business information NEEDS to be persisted. Some of it can be very valuable in the timeline sense. I posted a link recently within our internal Skyline Yammer about Mercury Marine expanding in Fon Du Lac. Is it interesting to Skyline? Maybe. Does it need to be in SharePoint for business needs? No. Is the information valuable for a short time frame? Definitely. It is that ephemeral type of content and discussion that Yammer is useful for.</p>
<p>So here is an EXCELLENT example of where Yammer is useful for an organization and how the concept of a timeline is valuable. Our CEO, Mitch Weckop, writes some pretty interesting blog posts on our SharePoint Intranet. Mitch talks about the economy or current legislation and how it can impact our business. Mitch meets with lots of our customers and shares his experiences in terms of how we can make Skyline better. Using these posts, Mitch does a great job trying to engage our associates in dialog. However, unless you subscribe to the blog posts via an alert or you notice it on our Skyline Intranet, our associates would miss it. However, if you log onto Yammer, where Mitch also posts a link back to his blog, it appears in our Associates’ timeline, right near the top, since it is recent. Organizationally, this timeline drives further value because unless you are Mitch, you are not seeing any comments that are being put on his blog after you visit it. When our company has a dialog within Yammer about the blog posts, everyone will see recent comments because they are at the top of the timeline. It essentially pokes the discussion back to the top of the information flow. Previously, this would not happen unless you were constantly checking the blog posts internally, because SharePoint does not have a great, “hey look here!” mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="/2014/01/11/index/yammer.png" alt="Yammer Home Page"></p>
<p>So ultimately, thing one I have come to understand about Yammer is the value comes in taking the flow of organizational information, and getting in front of people in terms of timeliness. THIS is the reason email continues to persist I believe. You have a timeline. You know the emails of today are MUCH more important than the information of six months ago. SharePoint as the persistence of business critical information has a difficult time projecting this information as a flow of time for its users. Hence, Microsoft’s buy of Yammer. It allows Microsoft to provide time pertinent information to organizations on top of SharePoint’s persistence based excellence.</p>
<p>Thing two about Yammer is the social aspect. Any of you folks who jump on Twitter realize you learn and understand people a bit better than you otherwise would. If you follow me on Twitter, you know I occasionally babble on my family, listen to too much music, etc. Is there any business value in that? You bet. As organizations grow, they are not going to have a metaphorical water cooler to gather at. Companies need to try and use a social tools like Yammer to get a sense of the people they work with. At Skyline recently we have learned through Yammer that some of our Green Bay associates were rocking some pretty awesome mustaches for Movember. We learned about the results of sponsorships we do for hackathons in Milwaukee. We also learned who is on the naughty list (Bear fans) and who is on the nice list (Packer fans), or vice versa. Using Yammer helps employees build social capital with your organization. The cool thing this social capital does is allow us to have bad days (I went to school at UW-Madison, so I apologize if this is getting too touch/feely). You are much more likely to give the benefit of the doubt to a peer when they have a bad day if you know them personally, and social tools like Yammer help build that for organizations, especially geographically disperse organization where you do not have day to day interactions. Digital tools will never be the most important part of building social capital, but it can be valuable part, because even though you may not interact on a day to day basis, you still can learn about your peers. With Yammer, you can help socialize your culture.</p>
<p>To summarize</p>
<p>1 – Yammer is timeline. Get timely information in front of associates and yourself</p>
<p>2 – Yammer is dialog. Dialoging about the timely information to provide input, feedback and discussion</p>
<p>3 – Yammer is NOT about persistence. Yammer is not the place for project proposals, financials, etc</p>
<p>4- Yammer is people. Yammer can be the virtual water cooler (or Skyline style, virtual coffee machine). An opportunity to engage people as people, rather than employees</p>
<p>5 – Yammer is NOT required. Just like you don’t want to try and keep up to date on your entire Twitter feed, you shouldn’t have to feel like that with Yammer. Business persisted information happens generally outside of Yammer, business supplementing happens with in. As cultures grow, this can change over time, but definitely not day one!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/01/08/index/'>Deleting Windows 8.1 Wireless Profiles</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Jan 7th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have had some pretty strange behavior after upgrading to Windows 8.1. With Windows 8, Microsoft syncs up your wireless
profiles to the cloud so when you have a new device, the wireless is already setup. So that is pretty cool. However, I
have been having issues with it.</p>
<p>For our home network, our SSID is not broadcast, like it should be on yours :). We manually add a hidden network and connect that way. With
Windows 8.1, I would not be able to connect sometimes. I would then type in the name of our (hidden) SSID and the associated Password.
It would then connect to the WiFi router, but the problem was it would create a new network profile each time. The way
Windows 8 appears to build the name is by adding the number for the new wirless profile by checking the cloud or synched
wireless profile that it could not connecting and adding one up to it. For example, if my wireless network is called
Network Name, the second time I connected it would be, Network Name 2. The third time I connected it would be Network Name 2 3,
and then Network Name 2 3 4, etc. . I ended up
with VERY long strings for my network names. It also appears to add these to the cloud based profile no matter how often
I clean up.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to figure out how to clean up my wireless profiles that have been synched to the cloud. I don&#39;t really
need or want the wireless profile for the restaraunt where I had a work meeting and accidently remembered the network. In the interim
I have used PowerShell to enumerate all of the profiles and delete them, except the first one (aka Network Name).</p>
<p>One of the things I want to do is spend more time in the command line this year. Mostly, I want to not have to lookup
how to do things to interact with GitHub. So in that vain, I wrote a PowerShell script to delete all but the first
wireless profile I created.</p>
<p>So here is the PowerShell script</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs lasso"><span class="hljs-variable">$profile</span> <span class="hljs-subst">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Network Name"</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$total</span> <span class="hljs-subst">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">32</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$count</span> <span class="hljs-subst">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>

netsh wlan show profiles
<span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> {

 <span class="hljs-variable">$execCommand</span> <span class="hljs-subst">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"netsh wlan delete profile name="</span><span class="hljs-string">"$profile"</span><span class="hljs-string">""</span>
 Write<span class="hljs-attribute">-Host</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$execCommand</span>)
 Invoke<span class="hljs-attribute">-Expression</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$execCommand</span>
 <span class="hljs-variable">$count</span><span class="hljs-subst">++</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$count</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">-le</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$total</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Also, as part of more command line, I have created a small GitHub repository to save scripts I create. Mostly so
I can grab them when I am other machines. Feel free to have at em</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/01/01/index/'>Chocolately and BoxStarter</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Dec 31st, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently received a new work computer (an <a href="http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/ASUS_ZENBOOK_UX301LA/">Asus i7</a> that
weighs 2.6 pounds, my old laptop, a Dell M6500 weighed over 8.5 lbs, it is like I am from the future now, but I digress).
One of the things that I don&#39;t like about getting a new PC is setting up the computer. I am very good about making sure
all of my files are stored in the cloud (via Skydrive and DropBox) and/or is under source control. I don&#39;t fear losing stuff, it
is the loss time in restoring my applications and environments that makes me crazy. I always forget to install a utility
I want. Or the exact moment I NEED to remote desktop is when I remember I forgot to ENABLE remote desktop.</p>
<p>However, since my last PC install, the world of Windows has changed, and its name is <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a>.
Chocolatey is similar to apt-get on Linux, or the NPM package manager for <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node</a>. You can, via
the command line, automatically install all kinds of applications that are available on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>.
For example, to install ReSharprer, fire up a command prompt and type</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">    cinst resharper
</code></pre>
<p>and away we go.</p>
<p>You can find out more at the <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a> site. Essentially though, you can achieve all of
this goodness by staring a command prompt and pasting the following</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command <span class="hljs-string">"iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"</span> &amp;&amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin
</code></pre>
<p>So, <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a> solves problem the first, allowing for command line install of applications.
When paired with <a href="http://boxstarter.org/">Boxstarter</a> however, it figures out problem the second of installing many different
applications that require reboots, etc, when you are setting up a new PC. BoxStarter handles reboots and logins
automatically for the user. You can type one command and be on your way!</p>
<p><a href="http://boxstarter.org/">Boxstarter</a> also enables me to setup a URL that will have all of the applications that I want
installed in a single location. For example, I created a Gist file on GitHub with all of the programs I want installed
when I have a PC.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs bash">    START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://gist.github.com/jptacek/<span class="hljs-number">8099099</span>/raw/f691b3433c09dcd361fca8cc6cfe637ca7521771/boxstarter
</code></pre>
<p>You can take a look at the file, but it is pretty basic.</p>
<p>I setup the Explorer options I want, for example, showing file extensions, and that provides me consistency across my
installs.</p>
<p>I then install the bevy of browsers that all web developers want at their disposal. This is followed by setups for Git,
NodeJS, Text Editor, coding utilities, etc. I even have installation for applications I use specifically at home, for
example, iTunes (I know, I vomit a little in my mouth each time I use it too).</p>
<p>Not only can you setup explorer options, but you can also setup your Windows environment! For example, I automatically
enable Remote Desktop, Setup HyperV and IIS on my development machines. I do this all from a single command and it
is awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>
A couple of people have run into issues if you are not using a default browser that does not support Click Once (for example
Google Chrome). Matt Wrock identifies the workaround in the comments below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like your default browser is not click-once enabled. Using START from the command line will invoke the url in your default browser. If that browser is IE or another browser that has a click-once extension, Boxstarter should be invoked. If Firefox or Chrome (or Opera or safari or anything not IE) is your default browser and you had no extension that is &quot;click once&quot; app aware, the behavior you describe sounds normal. Chrome is my default browser but I installed an extension from
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/">https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/</a> that will allow it to work with click once apps like Boxstarter&#39;s web launcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to reiterate... You need to update your default browser to support click once. Links for</p>
<ul>
<li>Google - <a href="https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/">https://code.google.com/p/clickonceforchrome/</a></li>
<li>FireFox - <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fxclickonce/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fxclickonce/</a></li>
