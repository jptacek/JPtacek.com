    <h1><a href='/2014/03/17/index/'>Twitter Bootstrap Themes</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 16th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>With a name like Ptacek, you would of course, have to know I am half-Irish. So, to celebrate, we are going to wrap
up a St Patrick&#39;s Day theme for the blog today (3/17/14). You may be saying to yourself, how could I spend so much time and effort totally
retheming the blog to support a relatively minor holiday on the calendar? Easy! Twitter Bootstrap themes!</p>
<p>Twitter Bootstrap, is obviously, a very popular web CSS framework. It enables web developers, without a lot of CSS expereince to
quickly create responsive sites that look decent out of the box. One of the interesting things you can do with version 3 of
Twitter Bootstrap is quickly  update your site easily using themes.</p>
<p>With Twitter Bootstrap, there are two ways you can do things. Option 1 is to download the minified files. This will result in three
separate files, <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> , <code>bootstrap-theme.min.css</code> and <code>bootstrap.min.js</code>, which
is used in conjunction with jQuery. The theme elements are then contained in the <code>bootstrap-theme.min.css</code> file.</p>
<p>The second approach you can use is to download the source files and compile the CSS yourself. This is done by downloading
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> files and using your favorite LESS compiler to generate CSS. There are also SASS files for the
 Ruby fans of the world. With the LESS approach,
there are separate files for theming, a <code>variable.less</code> file and a bootstrap theme file. This is the approach I use for this site
and most projects I start. Within the main <code>site.css</code> LESS file I import the theme files</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml">@import "bootstrapTheme/bootswatch.less";
@import "bootstrapTheme/variables-bootswatch.less";
</code></pre>
<p>The reason I like using the LESS approach rather than just downloading the minified CSS files is the theme part is a bit more
isolated. I can keep all the theme content, which I really think of as the &quot;skin&quot; for a Bootstrap site, in two separate files.
This enables new versions of Bootstrap to be downloaded without loosing other CSS changes and to quickly swap them out, like we
are doing here for St. Patrick&#39;s Day.</p>
<p>It should be noted, that out of the box, Twitter Bootstrap ships with a default theme, a theme that makes the site look like
Twitter Bootstrap 2.x. There is quite a growing community for creating themes for bootstrap (it&#39;s not WordPress type size,
that would just be crazy talk). Example sites include <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap.com</a>, <a href="http://bootstraptor.com/">Bootstraptor</a>
and the one I tend to gravitate to, <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>.</p>
<p>To update your site UI you just simply download either minified CSS files and swap them out, or two LESS files and then reference
them in your site. Since I use LESS, I download the LESS files, rename them to a theme name, which allows me to keep my original,
and then update my <code>site.css.less</code>. I called the St Patrick&#39;s Day theme shamrock and my references are now</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml">@import "bootstrapTheme/shamrock-bootswatch.less";
@import "bootstrapTheme/shamrock-variables.less";
</code></pre>
<p>Viola, a save and a publish later we have a total site look! It is like <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSSZenGarden</a> for
mortals.</p>
<p> <img src="http://www.jptacek.com/2014/03/Twitter-Bootstrap-3-Themes/BuildStPatty.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Rules"></p>
<p>You can find the St Patrick&#39;s Day theme I downloaded from Bootswatch <a href="http://bootswatch.com/shamrock/">here</a>. Obviously,
 since this is just for a short time, there are some UI things that would need to be redone on the site, but we will
 be back to our regularly scheduled programming soon!</p>
<p>Totally useless Ptacek news.... Obviously, the half Irish comes from my Mother&#39;s side. My Uncle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Durkin">Tom Durkin</a>, a somewhat famous horse
race announcer who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/sports/28durkin.html?version=&amp;action=click&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;region=searchResults#0&amp;module=Search&amp;url=http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/tom+durkin/&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1395057931-WaqX7ynUlBWydjqQznsZ1w">used to call</a> the Kentucky Derby and other Triple Crown races on television, would often get flown over
to call the Irish Derby. Here is one of my favorite race calls he has ever done, but probably more appropriate for Talk
Like a Pirate Day</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/03/14/index/'>National Pi Day - Calculating PI With AngularJS and a Monte Carlo Simulation</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 13th, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Every year on 3/14, Geeks everywhere can let their geek flag fly by
celebrating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day">National Pi Day</a>. On this day, every year, the date equals the first three
digits of π, 3.14. Last year we celebrated with a <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/03/have_your_pi/">blog post</a>, so let’s do it again!</p>
<p>In last year’s post, we calculated Pi using Leibiniz formula to determine π, which is a relatively slow algorithm.</p>
<p>This year we are going to look at a totally different approach, a Monte Carlo simulation.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulation</a> is a statistical approach where you use
random numbers to run a simulation over and over and record those results. It is very popular in the fields of finance,
fluid mechanics and the study of Brownian Motion. For our scenario today, you can also use a Monte Carlo method to calculate π!</p>
<p>To do this, we are going to use two geometric formulas, one to calculate the area of a square and the second the area of a
circle. If we put a circle of radius R in a square of length 2R, we have a scenario as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="/2014/03/14/index/PtacekPie_002.GIF" alt="Circle in Square"></p>
<p>The area of the rectangle will then be 4R<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>  and the area of the circle will be πR<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>.
Dividing the area of the circle by the area of the rectangle give us π /4. Stated another way, the ratio of area of the
circle to that of the square is Pi/4.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method comes into play because we will randomly put a point on the square. If the point falls within
the circle, we record it. The total ratio of points in the circle (aka, the area of the circle) to total points
(aka, the area of the square) will tell us π /4.</p>
<p>So, we now know a way to calculate π, the next step is to actually write some code. There are, obviously, many
ways we could go and do this, but lately I have been kicking the tires with AngularJS and thought this would work as
well as anything.</p>
<p>We won’t spend a lot of time jumping into AngularJS. You can check out some previous posts at
<a href="http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/">http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/</a> for an introduction.</p>
<p>We will have two things, our chemistryApp.js file to create our angular application, piApp, and our controller,
 where the interesting stuff will happen.</p>
<p>Our HTML file is pretty basic,</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"piApp"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">ng-app</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"piApp"</span>&gt;</span>

        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"piCalcDiff"</span> &gt;</span>{{delta}}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">br</span>/&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">button</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-click</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"calculatePi()"</span> &gt;</span>Update<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">button</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We will enter in the number of random dots (iterations) we want our simulation to run. The more dots, the closer we get.
We will then display the calculated value of π and how close we are to π actual. Last, we have a button that we will click to
execute our Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
<p>Our AngularJS controller is where the interesting stuff is happening, and that is not even particularly interesting.</p>
<p>We have created a function, determinePi, which will perform our calculation. We assume a circle with a radius of 1.
We then generate two random numbers, one for the x position and one for the y position. We know that
(x<sup>2&nbsp;</sup> + y<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>)=1 (the radius of our circle), so for any value that is less than this, we know we are
inside the circle and increment a counter for hits inside. Once we are done with the iterations, we determine our
calculated version of π and the difference from our known value of π for display on the page. In our calculation, we are only
really doing a quadrant, just to make the code a bit easier to follow. It all works though since we are just talking about
ratios.</p>
<p>This is not a super accurate, or super-fast method of calculating π, but it was an interesting chance to take a quick look at
Monte Carlo methods, which are common place with a subset of our clients.</p>
<div id="piApp" ng-app="piApp">
    <div id="piCtrl" ng-controller="piAppController">
        <input id="iteration" -ng-model="iterations"><br>
        <div id="piCalc">{{pi}}</div><br>
        <div id="piCalcDiff">{{delta}}</div><br>
        <button ng-click="calculatePi()">Update</button>
    </div>

<p></p></div><p></p>
<p>Happy Pi day! Go have a nice piece of Apple Pie and enjoy the day!!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/03/02/index/'>Speculations for Build 2014</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 1st, 2014</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Build is a Microsoft developer conference that has taken the place of their Professional Developer Conference (PDC). The first
Build was held in 2011 and introduced the world to Windows 8, along with an early preview of Windows 8 and a Samsung tablet.
You can read my thoughts on Build 2011 <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2011/09/observations-from-microsofts-build-conference/">here</a>.
In 2012, Build was held in Seattle and saw the release of Windows 8 and
Microsoft’s Surface RT tablet.  In 2013, Build was held in San Francisco and Microsoft announced Windows 8.1 as well as
made available a preview
release for developers. Before Build 2013 last year, I took a <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/06/Speculation-Microsoft-Build/">stab</a> at
 speculating about what would be coming and did pretty spectacularly bad. With Build 2014 a
month away, I thought it would be fun to try again!</p>
<p><img src="/2014/03/02/index/build2013.png" alt="Build 2013"></p>
<p>First, it is interesting to look at how short the time is becoming between Microsoft Build conferences</p>
<ul>
<li>Build 2011, Anaheim, CA September 13 - 16, 2011</li>
<li>Build 2012, Seattle, WA October 30 - November 2, 2012 (~13 months later)</li>
<li>Build 2013, San Francisco, CA June 26-28, 2013 (~8 months later)</li>
<li>Build 2014, San Francisco, CA April 2-4, 2014 (~9 months later)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that Microsoft is quickly iterating and getting information out to developers. However, having said that, certain parts
of Microsoft are executing VERY fast (I am looking at you Azure) and other parts are executing VERY slow (I am looking at you Windows
Phone). With the breadth of developer platforms Microsoft has, they have many opportunities to get in front of developers, but it
not always what the developers are expecting. So all of that to say this.... A lot of my speculation for Build this year looks a lot like last year! There are still some
important pieces for the Microsoft developer story that I believe have yet to be communicated.</p>
<p><img src="/2014/03/02/index/guitar.jpg" alt="3D Printer Guitar"></p>
<h3 id="one-api-to-rule-them-all">One API To Rule Them All</h3>
<p>The reality is, developing on the Microsoft stack
today can be downright confusing. You have options between....</p>
<ul>
<li>Web using MVC with HTML/JS/CSS</li>
<li>Web using Silverlight (version of XAML), though this is deprecated</li>
<li>Desktop using WPF (version of XAML)</li>
<li>Windows Modern/Metro/Store Apps using WinJS with HTML/JS/CSS</li>
<li>Windows Modern/Metro/Store Apps using XAML</li>
<li>Windows Phone (version of XAML)</li>
</ul>
<p>For shops that are all in on the Microsoft stack, it can be confusing to determine what to go all in on. If you are a web developer
and love HTML and JavaScript, your options are limited for Windows Phone. If you love all things XAML, you have to choose amongst
WPF, Windows Phone or Windows 8 flavor of XAML. And while the XAML platforms are similar, they are not similar enough to not
have a lot of rework. Things have gotten better though over the years with the introduction of the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CrossPlatformPortableClassLibrariesWithNETAreHappening.aspx">Cross-Platform portable class
library</a>, though it is still cumbersome hitting
multiple endpoints.</p>
<p>Last summer I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>One API To Rule Them All</strong> – With the core of Windows driving Xbox One, Windows Phone and Windows 8, will Microsoft release a single API that enables development across all of their platform? That would be great to see and could drive a lot of great applications across Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox!</p>
</div>

<p>This year, I can write the same thing. There have been <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/rumor-windows-phone-81-ditch-back-button">rumors</a>
 coming from a leaked release of the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK of Universal Binaries that will allow Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows
 RT/Metro/Modern/Store Apps have a common base. According to the earlier link, over 75% of Windows Phone and Windows RT have
 the same shared API. That would be a great starting point for Windows 8 developers, especially if WinJS development is now an option
 for Windows Phone 8.1. Giving developers the opportunity to have one platform they can choose to develop on and hit multiple devices
 in the Microsoft devices strategy would be a great leap forward.</p>
<h3 id="windows-rt">Windows RT</h3>
<p>Last summer I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>Windows RT</strong> – Microsoft Windows RT, the ARM based version of their Operating System, is in a weird place. It runs Metro/Modern Design apps in a full touch mode. It also ships with a subset of Microsoft Office such as Word and Excel. However it does not run other Windows applications. What it does do is run all day on a single charge. It is a great productivity tool for knowledge workers. However, with the release of Intel’s Haswell chipset it seems that all-day battery life will be available on much more powerful chipsets. What, then, becomes the future of Windows RT? Will it move to being Microsoft Windows Phone OS? Will Microsoft reduce the cost of Windows RT to get more hardware vendors building machines? Maybe we will find out more at Build!</p>
</div>

<p>Again, same thing this Build. Windows RT has not had a lot of explanation about its continued existence in the Windows ecosystem.
I am not 100% sure, but I believe the only devices released for WinRT in 2013 were from Lumia (<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/tablet/lumia2520/">Lumia 2520</a>) and Microsoft
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-2">Surface2</a>). The good news is, both of these devices were well received.
The battery life and productivity for ARM based tablets running RT make for great use cases. However, as Intel releases improved Haswell and Atom chips with great battery
life and the ability to run desktop applications, it doesn&#39;t make long term sense for Microsoft to support both platforms the way they are now.
Unless, Microsoft is focused on making Win RT the phone platform
as well as a tablet only platform, without the legacy desktop. I am pretty sure this is the case, but we haven&#39;t heard it from
Microsoft yet. Maybe this Build we will?!?!</p>
<h3 id="devices-and-services-company">Devices and Services Company</h3>
<p>Microsoft has repeatedly said they are now a devices and services company. Since this announcement in 2012, they have released both Windows
Surface Pro and Windows Surface RT, along with follow up versions in 2013. The Pro update was minimal in terms of hardware (adding the Haswell chip),
but the Surface RT 2,
now called Surface 2, saw a pretty significant upgrade in performance and hardware. In 2013, the release of Xbox One happened. Other
than that, not a whole lot in terms of devices.</p>
<p>Obviously, the purchase of Nokia&#39;s Lumia line will see a lot more Microsoft devices being released in 2014.
However these will be phone devices, there
has not been a 7-8 inch Surface release to compete with the iPad Mini or Kindle fire, the fastest growing tablet market. There also has not been a
Microsoft Laptop/Ultrabooks released. Further, we still are not sure what happens
to the Lumia Brand and the Surface Brand. Will they merge? Will one replace the other? Will one be the Tablet platform and the other the
Phone platform? Will one be for consumers and the other for enterprises? An explanation of these brands moving forward would be great!</p>
<p>I expect that Build 2014 will shed a lot more light on this, especially the company&#39;s strategy for integrating Nokia and the possible
announcement of a Surface Mini. In general, except for the first Build, it is not a place where Microsoft announces hardware though.</p>
<h3 id="xbox-one">Xbox One</h3>
<p>With the news that Xbox One is built on Windows 8, and a tease at Build 2013 about a JavaScript based API for Xbox One, everyone
I talk with thinks Xbox One will be part of Build 2014. Bring it on! This will be exciting for indie developers.</p>
<h3 id="windows-phone">Windows Phone</h3>
<p>My guess, and that of many others, is above all things, Build 2014 will be about Windows Phone 8.1. I, and most of the world, expect them to show Windows Phone
8.1 while hitting on the developer story. It may be even that some new Lumia devices are announced to drive developer enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="kinect-for-windows-rt">Kinect for Windows RT</h3>
<p>Last year I wrote</p>
<div class="well">
<p>Microsoft’s Kinect is impressive technology. Microsoft released a Kinect for Windows last year, but the hardware did not work on the RT side of the house. Will there be APIs in Windows RT for Kinect? Will there be new Kinect hardware?</p>
</div>

<p>This year, I again hope that the Kinect API will be part of the Win Metro API so developers can take advantage of the Kinect in
Windows 8.1 apps. The technology is too impressive for Microsoft to just let it be used on the Xbox platform!</p>
<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s Azure platform is amazing. The degree to which the Azure team can execute and release new features is dizzying. As someone
who is a big proponent of the cloud for organizations to embrace, I spend time following the various platforms. It is hard to keep up
with all the great things the Azure team is doing.</p>
<p>The one
thing that I am most interested in seeing from Microsoft over the next year, is if the speed of execution that Satya Nadella bought to the Azure team
when he led the group, can be bought to the whole Microsoft organization. If there is one person from within Microsoft that can
execute on the Microsoft One strategy, it is Satya. It will be something to watch in 2014.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-name">Pick a Name</h3>
<p>I am still very confused by what Microsoft calls its non-desktop platform, aka the Windows formerly called Metro. Is it Windows Store apps?
Is it Modern apps? Is it Win RT? What is the Microsoft design language formerly known as Metro called? It would be nice to clearly and
concisely pick the terms and have everyone use the same vocabulary. Even the Microsoft developers presenting at previous Builds still call
everything Metro!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have the sense that Build 2014 is really Build 2013, part 2. A lot of the pieces that weren&#39;t fully basked for Build last June, like Xbox One and Windows Phone 8.1,
 should
be announced this April. I am quite hopeful that the Microsoft One vision will be introduced for developers at Build 2014.
 I believe this will really help Microsoft accelerate application across multiple platforms and give developers a sense
 of ease about a single execution strategy. More to come!</p>
<p> I will be out at Build 2014. Feel free to hit me up on twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/jptacek">@jptacek</a> if you are out there in
 April.</p>
