    <h1><a href='/2011/03/25/index/'>Developing with Microsoft's Azure Platform</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Mar 24th, 2011</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>For the past several months, Skyline has been working on an awesome charity project called the <a href="http://www.appletoncompassion.org/">Appleton Compassion Project</a>. This project will provide visitors to the <a href="http://www.troutmuseum.org/">Trout Museum of Art </a>a way to view the 10,500 pieces in the exhibit and their accompanying artist statements. It has also provided us with an excellent opportunity to develop in Azure and learn a thing or two which I&#39;m going to share with you.</p>
<p>The Appleton Compassion Project is hosted on Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft&#39;s platform for developing cloud applications based on its Microsoft .NET technology. The good news is that if you&#39;re a programmer doing .NET development you are already well positioned to do Azure programming!</p>
<p>The cloud means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but in discussing Azure, we can think of it as providing several features.</p>
<p>First, it provides infrastructure. For the Appleton Compassion Project, this was important. The goals of the project were such that they were (and still are) hoping to have some big-name celebrities involved, which could result in a large number of visitors to the site. While we could plan for that kind of demand, the Appleton Area School District - who is sponsoring the project - could not afford the hardware to meet it. Since one of the features of Azure is the ease of scalability, it can quickly meet the demands by adding more compute instances (the virtual machines that Azure uses). This is an example of where we pay for what we use, and don&#39;t have to pay for demand that we plan for, that may or may not be used.</p>
<p>Second, it provides scale. This is a necessity as the Virtual Exhibit on the site will contain over 10,000 individual images that need to be displayed. The process we have to create the Pivot collection for our current batch of 8,000 images creates over 750,000 Deep Zoom files, is computationally intense, and literally takes days to run. We can greatly reduce this time by paying more and using larger computer sizes and creating multiple tasks in parallel. Once the files are created, we can then reduce the computer size to serve up HTML pages until we need the increase in computing power. Doing this kind of implementation using computing hardware as needed on the school district&#39;s hardware would not be cost effective.</p>
<p>Another variation of scale is disk space ... we only pay for what we use. We don&#39;t need to be concerned with checking for disk space before we run our collection creation process, estimating the amount of files we will create and ensuring we have enough. Azure will automatically grow and make redundant copies of our data, so that if the server goes down, the data is stored elsewhere.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Azure is based on .NET technologies, making it relatively straightforward to move to cloud development. There are, of course, several differences. When you deploy an application to Azure, it starts a dedicated Virtual Machine to host your application in a Microsoft data center. The bigger the size of the machine you request, the more you pay. One result of the virtual machine being created for each deploy is that you don&#39;t want to persist data to these VMs. You will use blob storage for persisted data. This is one of the biggest differences between Azure and normal .NET development.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2011/04/25/index/'>Create Interactive User Experiences Quickly and Easily with Silverlight Pivot Viewer</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Apr 24th, 2011</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>The Appleton Compassion Project, a recent charity project Skyline has completed, takes advantage of a great tool in the Microsoft toolset that few people know is out there, the Silverlight Pivot Viewer. Unfortunately, Microsoft has quite a few things named Pivot so you may find this confusing. Pivot Viewer is NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerPivot- This is an Excel tool that allows you to manipulate A LOT of data</li>
<li>Excel Pivot - This is your day to day Excel pivot
The Silverlight Pivot Viewer IS a tool that allow developers to quickly create an engaging and interactive data driven experience. To get an idea of what I&#39;m talking about, check out the <a href="http://www.appletoncompassion.org/VirtualExhibitViewer">Appleton Compassion Project Virtual Exhibit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This online exhibit contains over 10,000 pieces of art done by students at dozens of different schools. You can see how site visitors can quickly click a school or a grade and narrow down the art that is displayed. Clicking an image will show the student&#39;s compassion statement and other demographic information without having to write any special code.</p>
<p>So it looks nice, but how do we create something this interactive? The great part is it&#39;s really not too difficult!</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be done is create a Deep Zoom file, <a href="http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/blog/Pages/deepzoom.aspx">which I cover in another blog post</a>, that will provide the images for the viewing experience. An XML file, with the extension of CXML is created and that is the file the Silverlight Pivot Viewer consumes. The important thing to realize is there is NO User Interface code to write. To reiterate... ZERO user interface development is needed. You create the Deep Zoom file, create the CXML file, add the Pivot Viewer control to your Silverlight XAML and you have a HIGHLY interactive user experience.</p>
<p>The CXML file has four parts to it. The first is a node called Collection, it is the top level node for the XML file.</p>
<p>Second is a node called Facets. The facets are the categories that are displayed on the left of the screen. In the example above, School, Grade, Art Teacher and Teacher are all facets. The facets are then searchable within the Pivot Viewer. Visitors can type in a school name or use the check box to filter down the data.</p>
<p>Third is a node for all of the Items. For the Appleton Compassion Project, the items are all the artists who created art work and accompanying compassion statements.</p>
<p>The last node is the item node, which is the data that is used to populate the Pivot Viewer. The item node has data for each of the defined facets to populate the search experience on the left of the screen. For our example, a given artist would have a School Name, which are then automatically queried to create the list on the example.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of how the XML would look:</p>
<p>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-16&quot;?&gt;</p>
<collection xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" name="Appleton School Compassion Project" schemaversion="1.0" xmlns:p="http://schemas.microsoft.com/livelabs/pivot/collection/2009" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/collection/metadata/2009">

As you can see, it&#39;s relatively straight forward XML. There are many things I have not talked about, like the ability to have different types of data, sliders for your data, etc. Check out the links for more information.<p></p>
<p><strong>Why Use it?
</strong>The Silverlight Pivot viewer is a great data driven UI experience for end users. The creation process involves creating a Deep Zoom file and some Xml.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/pivotviewer/collection-xml-schema/">Silverlight Pivot XML Schema information </a></p>
<p>To Develop with the Silverlight Pivot viewer, you will need the Silverlight 4 SDK as well as the Pivot Viewer Control, which you can <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/pivotviewer/">download here</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2011/04/25/index/'>Microsoft's Deep Zoom Technology Allows for Powerful User Experience</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Apr 24th, 2011</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Closely tied to the Silverlight Pivot Viewer I discussed in my <a href="http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/blog/Pages/silverlightpivotviewer.aspx">previous blog post</a>, is Microsoft&#39;s Deep Zoom technology. Deep Zoom enables users to pan and zoom around a high resolution image, or in the case of how we use it for the <a href="http://www.appletoncompassion.org/VirtualExhibitViewer">Appleton Compassion Project Virtual Exhibit</a>, navigate a large collection of images.</p>
<p>Deep Zoom accomplishes this by using a process similar to Google/Bing maps. There are layers to the image, so one layer can show the entire collection with very small sizes for the images. The images are also broken up into tiles, so as you go to higher resolution images, it may be broken up into several tiles so you do not have to load the entire image. As you zoom closer into the document, you are navigating to layers that are deeper and deeper in the collection, with increasing image resolution and will be loading a tile that is a subset of the image. Microsoft has a nice picture of this and an accompanying description at their <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jaimer/archive/2008/03/31/a-deepzoom-primer-explained-and-coded.aspx">MSDN site</a>.</p>
<p>Deep Zoom consists of several XML based files. The first is the Deep Zoom image (DZI). This file is essentially an XML file that contains the layers and tile information for a given image. The Deep Zoom image creation process creates a directory for each image, this directory will then have the layers, and images that are broken into tiles. For example, in testing that we did, a single image taken with a home digital camera that is 4 MB in size, was broken up into 12 sub folders, each containing tiled images. One image created 12 directories and 238 files. For the Appleton Compassion Project, the collection of 10,000+ art pieces has created nearly one million files!</p>
<p>The second deep zoom file type is the Deep Zoom Collection (DZC). This file essentially is the high level collection that points to the DZI files. The Silverlight Pivot viewer then references this DZC file for the zooming process.</p>
<p>There are two ways to create Deep Zoom files. The first is to use the Deep Zoom composer that is part of Expression Blend. This process, outlined in the link above, is manual which obviously won&#39;t work for 10,000 images. The interesting thing is Microsoft really doesn&#39;t have an SDK or install for creating the Deep Zoom files. You need to physical copy a DLL from the Deep Zoom Composer directory and make it part of your application, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/expression/archive/2008/11/26/hello-deepzoomtools-dll-deep-zoom-image-tile-generation-made-easy.aspx">outlined here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use it?
</strong>Deep Zoom allows for a interactive zoom and pan user experience.</p>
