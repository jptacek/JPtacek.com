    <h1><a href='/2013/12/29/index/'>Saying Hello to.... DocPad</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Dec 28th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I recently <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/2013/12/saying-goodbye-to-wordpress/">blogged</a> about moving off of WordPress to a new blogging platform.
I have been looking at several different options during this time and have finally picked one. There were three that really piqued my interest; <a href="http://www.tryghost.org">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with hosting on Github, and <a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a>.</p>
<p>Each of the platforms had different things that made it interesting to me, and some things I did not like. Let&#39;s review each of them</p>
<h2 id="ghost">Ghost</h2>
<p><img src="/2013/12/29/index/GhostLogo.png" alt="Ghost Logo"></p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.Ghost.org">Ghost</a> is pretty awesome. When I started thinking about redoing my blog, it had a lot of things I was interested in. The platform is elegant. It uses Markdown for creating content, and the online editor for it is VERY nice. The other thing that really interested me is that it is all built on Node.JS. This is a platform I am definitely interested in growing my skill base.</p>
<p>However, despite all of these things, Ghost was not for me. In reality, is another blogging/CMS platform. The same limitations I was having with WordPress, in terms of page structure, adding JavaScript content, etc, would still be an impediment on Ghost. Essentially, Ghost is WordPress 2.0, a MUCH nice WordPress, hosted with Node.JS instead of PHP, but not for me and the things I would like to do.</p>
<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>
<p><img src="/2013/12/29/index/JekyllLogo.png" alt="Jekyll Logo"></p>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> was VERY close to being what I chose. The magic of Jekyll is that it creates static HTML from templates. Essentially, you create a page layout. You can then create posts and content using Markdown to be combined with your layout and it will create static HTML. By serving up static HTML, your hosting costs quickly become much less since you are serving up static pages, and millions of web servers over the world are VERY good at that.</p>
<p>Jekyll also has the added benefit of being tied to <a href="http://www.GitHub.com">GitHub</a> and its <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> platform. I can have the fine folks at GitHub and their operations folks be responsible for ensuring my site is up. It also has some slick features where you check in your Markdown file in GitHub and your site content is automatically deployed.</p>
<p>However, like Goldilocks finding the porridge a bit too cool, there were some things that steered me away. First, while the automatic updating feature is slick, it is a limited subset of the Jekyll functionality. Further, Jekyll is based on the Ruby programming platform. While I find that more interesting than WordPresss’ PHP, it is definitely not as high up on my list as Node.JS.</p>
<p>Which brings us too….</p>
<h2 id="docpad">DocPad</h2>
<p><img src="/2013/12/29/index/DocPadLogo.png" alt="DocPad Logo"></p>
<p>Ultimately, I ended up picking <a href="http://docpad.org/">DocPad</a>. I REALLY liked the idea of static page generation. I have been around the web now that it is all back where it started, with developers putting static HTML files on a server. Who would have thunk? Of course, this is much nicer since you have templates to go and create the site. It is also a Node.JS application, which is of interest. You can also auto deploy your markdown files and have it create the static HTML in an Azure web instance after you commit and push your changes to GitHub. VERY SLICK. Of course, I pay for the CPU part of that, and only when I create content. The rest will all be static HTML files being sent by IIS.</p>
<p>It is really very slick how easy the site setup was. I will detail my instructions down the road. I do LOVE the Node Package Manager and the magic of package.json which allows you to quickly get a site up and running on your machine.</p>
<p>I give a lot of credit to the site redo to my old <a href="http://www.SkylineTechnologies">Skyline</a> colleague and now Microsoft guy, <a href="http://www.yTechie.com">Jason Young</a>. As I was investigating my next blog platform, he published a <a href="http://www.ytechie.com/2013/11/blogging-awesomeness-with-a-static-generator-and-markdown/">post</a> about migrating his site to DocPad. The gold star for Jason was taking the DocPad site and configuring Azure to compile the markdown to static HTML and then set for hosting. This is what moved me from going to Jekyll to Docpad. VERY COOL!</p>
<p>Also, hat tip to <a href="http://www.ewal.net/">Erv Walter</a> for great stuff he did in setting up the platform and UI that Jason and I have both, VERY liberally borrowed from.</p>
<p>Obviously, my site has a lot of UI cleanup I would like to do, I also need to edit a lot of posts, but here it is, in all of it&#39;s static glory.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Why DocPad</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.JS platform</li>
<li>Templating engine to allow creation of static HTML files</li>
<li>Enable Javascript on pages</li>
<li>Auto publish from a GitHub repository</li>
<li>Markdown language for publishing</li>
<li>Lots of extensibility via Plugins</li>

    <h1><a href='/2013/12/28/index/'>Saying Goodbye to WordPress</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Dec 27th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I have been using WordPress for a while with my personal blog, <a href="http://www.jptacek.com">JPtacek.com</a>. I have been a big fan and have written up many posts about setting up <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/tag/wordpress/">WordPress</a> using the awesomeness of Azure websites. However, the time to move on has come upon to a new blogging platform.
<img src="/2013/12/28/index/sylvester.jpg" alt="Sylvester ByeBye"> <img src="/2013/12/28/index/wordpressLogo.jpg" alt="WordPress logo">
So the question is why... Well here is my reasoning</p>
<ul>
<li>A CMS does a great many things, but ultimately they are for people to be able to host websites and publish content. And most CMSes are for people who do not want to learn about things like HTML. However, with a developer background I kept running into things I could easily do in HTML, but were near impossible within WordPress</li>
<li>Azure is great, however I still pay for Azure. I am responsible for CPU and bandwidth. Since WordPress is a platform, every page requests is essentially run through a CPU, where the WordPress blackbox does its magic, queries a database and spits out HTML. This is a cost. (To be honest, it is not a BIG cost)</li>
<li>It always felt a bit goofy to have simple web pages hosted in a back end database. Everything starts as a document or HTML, then gets thrown into a database. I need to be responsible for backing up the database and being a good admin type person. I would rather just have my one true source be HTML that I can save in Dropbox or SkyDrive</li>
<li>PHP is not my thing. I am always up for learning something new, but PHP is NOT something I that is on the learn something new list.</li>
<li>Update, update, update. Since WordPress is a platform, hackers tend to get bored and are always looking to hack into it. You constantly need to be aware of keeping your software and plugins up to date if you are hosting your own WordPress environment. This is not an issue if you are hosting at <a href="http://www.WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>, but I am not, on account of the awesomeness of Azure Websites</li>
<li>Truthfully, probably the biggest reason is JavaScript. Doing web front end things with WordPress is really not a pleasant experience. I have found myself resorting to embedding <a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net">JSFiddles</a> into my pages to show functionality that is plain easy to do on other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what am I looking for?</p>
<ul>
<li>More web, please. I want to be able to have a blog engine that supports HTML and JavaScript, rather than make me miserable</li>
<li>Speedy please</li>
<li>Reduce hosting costs, please</li>
<li>Help me learn something new, please</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been spending time thinking about this. I believe I have an answer. Any suggestions from you oh mighty Internet?</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/12/12/index/'>Calculating the Cost of the 12 Days of Christmas</a></h1>
    
        <div class="post-date">Dec 11th, 2013</div>

    <div class="post-content">
        <script src="/2013/12/calculating-the-cost-of-the-12-days-of-christmas/scripts/12DaysApp.js"></script>
<script src="/2013/12/calculating-the-cost-of-the-12-days-of-christmas/scripts/christmasController.js"></script>

<p>Every year in December, families gather around the table to celebrate Christmas. If your house is anything like my house, the good times, food and conversation can quickly escalate into a battle over what is the true cost of the classic Christmas Song, the 12 Days of Christmas! This year, I took matters into my own hand and wrote a calculator, that will calculate the cost of the 12 days of Christmas using Google&#39;s Javascript Framework, AngularJS. No more bickering at the family table over the holidays!</p>
<p>AngularJS is a Javascript framework from Google that focuses on building complex data applications. It has a very strong data first philosophy, which is a little different than jQuery which focuses more on DOM manipulation. You can find out more about AngularJS at the <a href="http://angularjs.org/">official site</a>, or read some recent blog posts I have written up at <a href="http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/">http://www.jptacek.com/tags/angularjs/</a>.</p>
<p>AngularJS is a Model View Controller (MVC) framework. The model represents our data, or an object. In our case, the model will be the cost of the items in the twelve days of Christmas; e.g., a partridge, a pear tree, a turtle dove, etc. The view is our HTML page which is responsible for displaying data. The controller is responsible for marshalling the data to the view, and helping control its state. To enable our 12 Days calculator, we will take advantage of these AngularJS features.</p>
<p>First, we essentially wire up our page to indicate we are going to have an Angular app by putting a <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-app</span> attribute in the HTML body tag. Next, we set an area of our HTML markup that our controller is responsible for with a <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-controller</span> attribute in a DIV tag.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">body</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">ng-app</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"christmasApp"</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">b</span>&gt;</span>12 Days of Christmas Calculator<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">b</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"container"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"12Days"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">ng-controller</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"christmasController"</span>&gt;</span>
...
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It is worth nothing that use of data-* attributes is more &quot;semantically&quot; correct. If you want to save yourself keystrokes, you can just use <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-app</span> or <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-controller</span>, but if you get bothered by having warnings in your code, like me, you will want to use <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-app</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, this being Javascript and all, we need references to JavaScript files that contain this logic for implementation. Usually in structuring a project there will be an chemistryApp.js file that sets up your Angular application, controllers for interacting between your model and the view as well as services.</p>
<p>Our chemistryApp.js file, which we call 12DaysApp.js, is just two lines and creates the scope we reference in our body markup, christmasApp.</p>
<p><em>12DaysApp.js
</em></p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> christmasApp = angular.module(<span class="hljs-string">'christmasApp'</span>, []);
</code></pre>
<p>Our next Javascript file is the controller and this is where the interesting stuff is. Essentially, AngularJS has the concept of a <span style="font-family:Courier New">$scope</span>. This is essentially a glorified property bad or state manage for interacting with the page. Within our controller, we create variables on the scope for each of our items. We are grabbing costs from a USA Today story from last year (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/11/26/12-days-of-christmas-107k/1726807/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/11/26/12-days-of-christmas-107k/1726807/</a>).</p>
<p>To setup our controller, we create a controller with a callback such as</p>
<p>_christmasController.js</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs javascript">christmasApp.controller(<span class="hljs-string">'christmasController'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">christmasController</span><span class="hljs-params">($scope)</span> {</span>

);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice passing in the $scope variable on the parameter list. AngularJS does a VERY nice job with Dependency Injection. By passing in the $scope variable we are enabling its use within our controller and the HTML view. As you explore Angular, you will come to appreciate how quickly you can add services or logging, etc. with their Dependency Injection framework.

We can then create a variable on the scope to set the cost for items we are getting for the 12 days of Christmas. For example, to set the price of a pear tree to $189.99 and a partridge, we have the following lines in our controller

<code>javascript
$scope.pearTree = 189.99;
$scope.partridge = 15.00;</code>

We then create a JavaScript function to calculate the cost of the first day.

<code>javascript
  $scope.day1 =  function () {
  return parseFloat($scope.pearTree) +  parseFloat($scope.partridge);
 };</code>

Now, the magic of two way data binding can start, by including the AngularJS library, our application JavaScript file and our Controller JavaScript file, get two way databinding. In our HTML markup, curly braces ( <span style="font-family:Courier New">{{ }}</span> ) indicate our AngularJS model.

So for the following markup, the <span style="font-family:Courier New">ng-model=&quot;partridge&quot;</span> on our Input element says that we are two way binding the <span style="font-family:Courier New">$scope.partidge</span> value in our UI. And since this binding is part of a HTML Input box, whenever we make changes, it will update our UI. For example, we are displaying the Day 1 whatever value we initially set will be displayed. We then automatically update the value of function day1 via the function. This function is automatically updated and our UI as well whenever we type in a new value. This is pretty magical for developers who used to capture JavaScript key up and down events!
